Procedural Text Understanding through Python Code Representation

## Overview
This NLP research project is devoted to the development of advanced procedural text understanding techniques utilizing Python code representation. Our focus is on enhancing and challenging the reasoning capabilities of Language Learning Models (LLMs), transforming multiple-choice questions into functions using Python code to represent procedural text, and executing the code to achieve results.

## Motivation
Real-world tasks or events understanding by AI assistants is a crucial aspect of their efficiency and usefulness. Although recent advancements have shown promise in procedural text understanding, real-world instructions often entail more complex relations between events and entities, which has been insufficiently explored. Limitations of existing work involve weak reasoning about implicit events, high dependence on context, difficulty handling long, intricate processes, and a failure to generalize across different scenarios due to domain-specific models. Leveraging Python code representations, which show potential in boosting LLMs reasoning capabilities, we aim to address these shortcomings.

## Datasets
We will be using two primary datasets for this project:

- [OpenPI (Tandon et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.520/): This dataset tracks state changes in procedural text across different domains using an open vocabulary. It is integral to our procedural text understanding approach testing.

- [WIQA (Tandon et al., 2019)](https://allenai.org/data/wiqa): This dataset is a collection of "What if..." questions, offering a perturbation and possible effect over procedural text. It aids us in creating Python code representations for complex causal reasoning tasks.
