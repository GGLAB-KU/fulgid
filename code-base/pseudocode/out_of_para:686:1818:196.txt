1. Carbon dioxide enters through stomata in leaves
2. Water is absorbed through roots
3. Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll
4. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight
5. Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen
6. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere
7. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide combine to create glucose
8. Glucose is used as food for the plant

Pseudocode:

1. Take in carbon dioxide through stomata in leaves
2. Absorb water through roots
3. Check if chloroplast cells are present in leaves
4. If chloroplast cells are present, absorb energy from sunlight using chlorophyll
5. Split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using absorbed energy
6. Release oxygen into the atmosphere
7. Combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to create glucose
8. Use glucose as food for the plant.
