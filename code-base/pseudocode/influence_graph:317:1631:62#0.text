1. Input: Rocks
2. Water seeps into rocks
3. If temperature drops below freezing point, then water freezes
4. If temperature rises above freezing point, then water thaws
5. Freezing and thawing of water causes cracks to form in rocks
6. Rocks also crack when heated up
7. Over time, cracks in rocks become larger and more numerous
8. Rocks slowly break down due to the formation and expansion of cracks
9. Output: Broken down rocks
