1. Set magma = rock inside Earth's crust
2. Melt magma to form molten rock
3. Set magma chambers underneath volcano
4. Collect molten rock inside magma chambers
5. Build pressure in magma chambers as they fill
6. Gain energy for eruption
7. Convert some energy into seismic activity (earthquakes)
8. If magma is thick and sticky, trap gases
9. Result in explosive eruption when pressure becomes too intense
10. If magma is thin and runs, result in low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of violent eruption.
