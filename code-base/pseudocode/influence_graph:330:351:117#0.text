1. Sunlight shines on plants
2. Cells with chlorophyll capture light energy
3. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through stoma
4. Plants absorb water through roots and other parts
5. Plants absorb minerals through roots
6. Convert inputs into sugars
7. Sugars can be used as energy sources
8. Oxygen and water are produced
9. Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant. 

Pseudocode:

1. Get sunlight
2. If cells have chlorophyll, capture light energy
3. If stoma is open, absorb carbon dioxide
4. Absorb water through roots and other parts
5. Absorb minerals through roots
6. Convert inputs into sugars
7. Use sugars as energy sources
8. Produce oxygen and water
9. Release excess water and oxygen through stoma and other parts of the plant.
