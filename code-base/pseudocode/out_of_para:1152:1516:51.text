1. Check if the atom has too few or too many neutrons.
2. If the atom is unstable, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, end the procedure.
3. Determine the type of decay (alpha or beta).
4. If alpha decay, release two protons and two neutrons from the atom. End the procedure.
5. If beta decay, change a neutron into a proton and an electron.
6. Join the proton to the nucleus of the atom.
7. Release the electron.
8. End the procedure.
