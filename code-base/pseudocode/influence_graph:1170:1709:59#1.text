1. Prophase:
- chromosomes become visible
- centrioles separate to move to opposite poles

2. Metaphase:
- chromosomes line up in the center

3. Anaphase:
- chromatids separate
- are pulled apart

4. Telophase:
- chromosomes gather at opposite poles
- two new nuclear membranes form
- cell membranes pinch
- divide into two individual cells
