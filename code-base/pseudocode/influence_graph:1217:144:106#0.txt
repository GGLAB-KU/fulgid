1. Define a function called "treeLifeCycle" that takes no parameters.
2. Within the function, create a variable called "seeds" and set it to a random number between 10 and 100.
3. Create a loop that will run until "seeds" is equal to 0.
4. Within the loop, create a variable called "dispersal" and set it to a random method of seed dispersal (e.g. wind, animals, etc.).
5. If "dispersal" is wind, subtract a random number between 1 and 10 from "seeds".
6. If "dispersal" is animal, subtract a random number between 1 and 5 from "seeds".
7. If "seeds" is less than or equal to 0, break out of the loop.
8. If "seeds" is greater than 0, create a variable called "newTrees" and set it to a random number between 1 and 10.
9. Create a loop that will run until "newTrees" is equal to 0.
10. Within the loop, create a variable called "growth" and set it to a random method of growth (e.g. sunlight, water, etc.).
11. If "growth" is sunlight, add a random number between 1 and 5 to "newTrees".
12. If "growth" is water, add a random number between 1 and 10 to "newTrees".
13. If "newTrees" is less than or equal to 0, break out of the loop.
14. If "newTrees" is greater than 0, call the "treeLifeCycle" function recursively.
