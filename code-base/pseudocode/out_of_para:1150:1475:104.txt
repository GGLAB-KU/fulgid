1. Create a photovoltaic cell with two layers of semiconductor material.
2. Dope the top layer with impurities to allow for a negative charge.
3. Dope the bottom layer to allow for a positive charge.
4. Create an electric field between the two layers to allow for the flow of electrons from negative to positive.
5. Allow sunlight to enter the cell.
6. Energy from the sunlight knocks electrons loose in both fields, preventing the flow of electrons from negative to positive.
7. Add an external circuit to allow for the exchange of electrons to continue.
8. Provide the cell's owner with a flow of electricity.
