1. Initialize a network of trees.
2. Allow the trees to grow and form a forest ecosystem.
3. As trees die off, leave the dead material on the forest floor.
4. The dead material provides nutrients for new trees to grow.
5. The new trees provide shelter for other organisms to thrive.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 to continue the cycle of growth and decay in the forest ecosystem.
