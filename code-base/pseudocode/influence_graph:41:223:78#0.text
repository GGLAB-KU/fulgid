1. Initialize variables for crack development, pressure, rock hardness, and seismic wave generation.
2. While cracks are developing:
   a. Determine the size and length of the cracks.
   b. Calculate the pressure exerted by the earth on both sides of the cracks.
   c. Determine the hardness of the rocks on both sides of the cracks.
   d. Apply pressure to the rocks, causing them to press against each other.
   e. Monitor the development of the cracks and the movement of the earth.
   f. If the pressure and movement cause rocks to crumble, release a lot of energy.
   g. Generate seismic waves from the energy released.
3. End the procedure when the earthquake has subsided.
