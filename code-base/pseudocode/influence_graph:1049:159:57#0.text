1. Input: Water and iron object
2. Combine water and iron object
3. Check for presence of carbon dioxide in the air
4. If carbon dioxide is present, combine with water to form carbonic acid
5. As carbonic acid is formed, iron object starts to dissolve
6. Break down some water into hydrogen and oxygen
7. Free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together
8. Form iron oxide, which is rust
9. Output: Rusty iron object
