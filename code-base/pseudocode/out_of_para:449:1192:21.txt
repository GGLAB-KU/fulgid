1. Set rock as magma from a volcano
2. While rock is hot, cool it down
3. Crystals form within the rock
4. Set the rock as igneous
5. If the igneous rock is exposed to weathering and erosion, it breaks down into sediment
6. Set the sediment as sedimentary rock
7. If the sedimentary rock is subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity, it becomes metamorphic rock
8. Set the metamorphic rock as the new rock
9. If the metamorphic rock is exposed to high temperatures, it melts and becomes magma again
10. Repeat from step 1.
