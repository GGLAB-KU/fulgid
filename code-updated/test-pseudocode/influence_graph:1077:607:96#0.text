1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Break up the helix using chemicals
3. If the helix splits as intended, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, abort the replication process.
4. Split the helix into two strands
5. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
6. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
7. Assemble the new strands into a double helix structure
8. Complete the replication process
9. End the procedure.
