1. Set volcano = true
2. Set magma = hot
3. Set water_in_clouds = true
4. While volcano is true:
   a. If water_in_clouds is true:
      i. Decrease the temperature of the magma required for it to rise towards the surface of the volcano
   b. Magma rises towards surface of volcano
   c. Magma cools
   d. If magma is released from volcano:
      i. Set magma = lava
      ii. Lava cools and solidifies into hard rock
   e. Magma starts to harden as it cools
4. End procedure.
