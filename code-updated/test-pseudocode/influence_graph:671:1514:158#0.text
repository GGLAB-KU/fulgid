1. Input: Liquid
2. Set a warmer temperature for Liquid
3. Heat Liquid from external source
4. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
5. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
6. Increase in temperature of Liquid
7. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
8. If temperature has reached boiling point, change Liquid to gas state
9. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
10. Check if all Liquid has turned to gas
11. If all Liquid has turned to gas, evaporate completely
12. If temperature is warmer, check if it will affect evaporation
13. If warmer temperature affects evaporation, adjust temperature accordingly to achieve desired evaporation rate
14. Output: No Liquid left behind
