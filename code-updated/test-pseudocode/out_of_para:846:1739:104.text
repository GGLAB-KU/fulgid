The given statement about excavating a hole for a pumpkin seed does not seem to be related to the procedure of waste removal from the body. However, if we assume that the statement is related to the procedure, we can update the pseudocode as follows:

1. Deliver oxygen through blood
2. Break down proteins and acids in liver
3. Release urea waste from liver
4. Transport urea and carbon dioxide to kidneys through blood
5. Strain urea and salts from blood in kidneys
6. Transport carbon dioxide byproduct back to lungs through blood
7. Exhale carbon dioxide from lungs
8. If a hole is excavated for a pumpkin seed, it will not affect the waste removal process from the body.
