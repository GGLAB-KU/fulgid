1. Set initial number of frog eggs
2. For each frog egg:
   a. Frog egg hatches
   b. Initialize tadpole count to 1
   c. For each tadpole:
      i. Tadpole breaks free
      ii. While gills are present:
          1. Gills slowly disappear over 6 weeks
      iii. At 8 weeks:
          1. Hind legs begin to form
      iv. At 12 weeks:
          1. Front legs form
      v. While tail is present:
          1. Tail shrinks
      vi. Mouth grows larger
      vii. If tadpole survives:
          1. Tadpole can live on land as a frog
      viii. If tadpole does not survive:
          1. Decrement tadpole count
   d. If tadpole count is 0:
      i. Frog egg did not produce any surviving tadpoles
   e. If tadpole count is less than initial count:
      i. Less tadpoles survived due to increased number of frogs
   f. If tadpole count is equal to initial count:
      i. All tadpoles survived
4. End loop
