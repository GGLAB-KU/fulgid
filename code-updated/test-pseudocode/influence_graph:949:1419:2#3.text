1. Get water from a lake or ocean
2. Heat the water until it evaporates
3. Collect the water vapor and store it in the atmosphere
4. Allow the water vapor to accumulate
5. Form clouds from the accumulated water vapor
6. Monitor the weight of the clouds
7. If the clouds become too heavy, initiate precipitation
8. Collect the precipitation and return it to the lake or ocean
9. If more precipitation occurs, increase the amount of water that accumulates in the atmosphere
10. Repeat steps 5-9 as necessary to account for increased precipitation.
