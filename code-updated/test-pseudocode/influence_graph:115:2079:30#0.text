1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, check for temperature
8. If magma is extra hot, reduce the likelihood of volcano formation
9. If magma is not extra hot, force it to the surface
10. Form volcano from magma.
