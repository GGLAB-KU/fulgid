1. Set fish as eggs
2. Hatch eggs
3. Emergence of larvae
4. Maturation and growth of larvae
5. Development of adolescent fish (or fry)
6. Growth of adolescent fish
7. Check for sub-stages based on species or type
8. Maturation of fish into adult
9. If fishing is reduced, decrease the number of fish caught
10. If the number of fish caught decreases, the fish population will increase
11. An increase in fish population may lead to competition for resources
12. Competition for resources may result in slower growth and development of fish
13. The fish may also experience changes in behavior and migration patterns
14. Ultimately, the long-term effects of reduced fishing on fish populations will depend on various factors, including the species of fish, the ecosystem, and the fishing practices employed.
