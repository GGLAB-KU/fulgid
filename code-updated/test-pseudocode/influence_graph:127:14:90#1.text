1. Set water in a pan
2. Place pan over a fire
3. Expose pan to heat energy
4. Check water temperature
5. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
6. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 7
7. Break down water molecules using heat energy
8. Allow molecules to escape from water
9. Water becomes vapor
10. Check for any factors that may affect vapor production
11. If there are factors that may affect vapor production, adjust heat energy accordingly to produce less vapor
12. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
