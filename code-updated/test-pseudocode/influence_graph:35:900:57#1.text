1. Input: Different kinds of rocks, Magma
2. Process: 
   a. Check if the temperature of magma is hot enough to melt rocks
   b. If the temperature is not hot enough, skip step c and d
   c. Rocks melt into magma
   d. Magma cools in the crust
   e. Magma rises to the surface and becomes lava
   f. Lava cools
   g. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock
   h. If the temperature is not hot enough, the magma will still cool the crust but will not melt the rocks
3. Output: Igneous rock or cooled crust
