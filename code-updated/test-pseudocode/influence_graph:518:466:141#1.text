1. Set initial number of adult fish
2. Adult fish lay eggs
3. Eggs incubate for a few weeks or months
4. Eggs hatch into young fish
5. Young fish remain in hatching area until they are big enough to venture into open water
6. Fish continue to grow
7. Fish reach adulthood
8. Adult fish reproduce
9. If there are more adult fish, competition for resources increases
10. If there are less fish, competition for resources decreases
11. Adjust the availability of resources based on the number of fish
12. Cycle continues from step 2.
