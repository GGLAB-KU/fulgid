1. For each flower in the environment:
2.   Bee visits the flower
3.   Pollen sticks to bee
4.   Bee flies to another flower of the same type
5.   Pollen on bee brushes onto pistil of flower
6.   Flower is pollinated
7.   If there are more flowers in the environment, the chances of less flowers being pollinated increases
8. End for loop
