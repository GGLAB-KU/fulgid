Here's an updated pseudocode that takes into account the scenario where bees become extinct:

1. Flower produces pollen
2. Wind or other natural forces disperse pollen
3. Pollen lands on other flowers, pollinating them
4. If bees are present, they may collect pollen on their legs
5. If bees are absent, less pollen falls off and remains on the flower
6. This may result in reduced cross-pollination and genetic diversity in plant populations
7. It may also impact the food chain and ecosystem as a whole.
