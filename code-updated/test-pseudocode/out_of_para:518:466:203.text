1. AdultFish lays Eggs
2. If less magma is formed, then fewer Eggs are laid
3. Eggs incubate for a few weeks or months
4. If Eggs are not hatched, go back to step 3
5. YoungFish remain where they hatched until they are big enough to venture into the open water
6. If YoungFish are not big enough, go back to step 5
7. Fish continue to grow
8. If Fish are not big enough, go back to step 7
9. Fish reach adulthood
10. If Fish are not adults, go back to step 9
11. AdultFish reproduce, continuing the cycle
12. Go back to step 1
