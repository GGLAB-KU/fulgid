1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Check if the cell is healthy and functioning properly
3. If the cell is healthy, proceed with replication
4. Break up the helix using chemicals
5. Split the helix into two strands
6. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
7. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
8. Complete the replication process
9. If the cell is not healthy or functioning properly, stop replication
10. End the procedure.
