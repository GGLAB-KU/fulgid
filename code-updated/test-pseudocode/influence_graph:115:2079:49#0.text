1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, force it to the surface
8. Form volcano from magma
9. Check if more magma is forced up
10. If more magma is forced up, it may cause the mountain ranges to grow larger.
