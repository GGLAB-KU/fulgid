1. Set up a loop for tectonic plate movement
2. If two plates collide, continue to the next step
3. The edges of the plates crumple up
4. If the crumpling is significant enough, continue to the next step
5. The ridges are formed into mountain ranges
6. If less crops grow, continue to the next step
7. The reduced vegetation leads to less soil retention and erosion
8. If erosion is significant enough, continue to the next step
9. The reduced soil and sediment can affect the size and stability of larger mountains over time.
