1. Evaporation:
   - Set initial water surface area
   - Set initial temperature
   - Set initial wind speed
   - Set initial urine production rate
   - While temperature, wind speed, and urine production rate remain constant:
     - Calculate rate of evaporation based on surface area, temperature, and urine production rate
     - Reduce water surface area by the amount of water evaporated
     - Output water vapor

2. Atmospheric Rise:
   - Set initial altitude
   - While water vapor is being output:
     - Increase altitude of water vapor
     - Output water vapor at new altitude

3. Condensation:
   - Set initial temperature and pressure
   - While water vapor is rising:
     - Calculate rate of condensation based on temperature and pressure
     - Convert water vapor to tiny particles of water/ice
     - Output particles of water/ice

4. Cloud/Fog Formation:
   - Set initial particle density
   - While particles of water/ice are being output:
     - Increase particle density
     - Combine particles of water/ice into clouds or fog
     - Output clouds or fog

5. Precipitation:
   - Set initial wind speed and temperature
   - While clouds or fog are present:
     - Calculate rate of precipitation based on wind speed and temperature
     - Convert particles of water/ice to rain/snow
     - Output rain/snow

6. Surface Water Collection:
   - Set initial surface area
   - While rain/snow is falling:
     - Increase surface area
     - Collect fallen rain/snow into surface water
     - Output surface water

7. Evaporation (repeat step 1)

Note: If the urine production rate increases, the rate of evaporation will also increase, leading to a more intense water cycle. This could result in more frequent and intense precipitation events, which could lead to flooding or other water-related issues.
