1. Set initial amount of water on earth
2. While there is water on earth:
   a. If sunny days are less intense:
      i. Water evaporates from the earth at a slower rate
      ii. The evaporated water condenses into water drops
      iii. The water drops fall back to earth
      iv. The water accumulates on the earth
      v. The water collects into bodies of water
      vi. The water soaks into the earth
   b. Else (if sunny days are normal):
      i. Water evaporates from the earth
      ii. The evaporated water condenses into water drops
      iii. The water drops fall back to earth
      iv. The water accumulates on the earth
      v. The water collects into bodies of water
      vi. The water soaks into the earth
   c. Update the amount of water on earth
3. End while loop.
