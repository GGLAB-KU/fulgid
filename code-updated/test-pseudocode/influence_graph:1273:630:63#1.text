1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant or manually transfer the pollen from the stamen to the pistils using a brush or cotton swab.
3. If an insect or bird lands on the plant, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. If manually transferring the pollen, ensure that the brush or cotton swab is gently rubbed against the stamen to collect the pollen and then gently rubbed against the pistils of the same or another plant of the same species to transfer the pollen.
5. If the plant is kept indoors, manual transfer of pollen is the only option for transferring pollen to a new plant.
