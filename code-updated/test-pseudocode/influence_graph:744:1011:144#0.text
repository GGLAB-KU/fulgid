      i. Bee may deposit more pollen on the flower
      ii. Bee may fly to fewer areas due to the increased weight of pollen on its fur
   h. If there is less pollen on the bee's fur due to weather conditions:
      i. Bee may deposit less pollen on the flower
      ii. Bee may fly to more areas to compensate for the lack of pollen on its fur
