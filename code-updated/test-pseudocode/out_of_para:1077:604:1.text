1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Check if there is a decrease in the chemicals that break up the helix
3. If there is a decrease, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, skip to step 5.
4. Adjust the amount of chemicals to ensure the helix is properly broken up
5. Split the helix into two strands
6. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
7. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
8. Complete the replication process
9. Check if there is a decrease in the number of fish born
10. If there is a decrease, end the procedure with a message indicating the impact of the decrease in fish on the replication process. Otherwise, end the procedure.
