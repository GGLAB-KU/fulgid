1. Blood delivers oxygen in the body
2. Liver breaks down proteins and acids
3. Liver releases waste in the form of urea
4. Blood carries urea and carbon dioxide to the kidneys
5. Kidneys strain urea and salts needed from the blood
6. Carbon dioxide byproduct is transported back to the lungs
7. Lungs exhale carbon dioxide

Pseudocode:

1. Deliver oxygen through blood
2. Break down proteins and acids in liver
3. Release urea waste from liver
4. Transport urea and carbon dioxide to kidneys through blood
5. Strain urea and salts from blood in kidneys
6. Transport carbon dioxide byproduct back to lungs through blood
7. Exhale carbon dioxide from lungs

If less waste happens, it may result in a decrease in the amount of urea and carbon dioxide transported to the kidneys. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled by the lungs. However, the exact impact on the amount of carbon dioxide would depend on the specific changes in the amount of waste produced.
