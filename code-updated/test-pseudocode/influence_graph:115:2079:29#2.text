1. Set tectonic plates variable to true
2. Set hole variable to false
3. While tectonic plates are true:
   a. Tectonic plates smash together
   b. The edges of the plates crumple up
   c. The ridges are mountain ranges
   d. If hole is false, continue to step e. If hole is true, skip to step f.
   e. Magma is forced to the surface
   f. Magma forms a volcano
   g. If more volcanoes are desired, set hole variable to true and repeat steps d-f.
4. End while loop.
