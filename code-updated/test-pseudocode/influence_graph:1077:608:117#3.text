1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Break up the helix using chemicals
3. Check if the helix is split into two strands
4. If the helix is not split, terminate the replication process
5. If the helix is split, use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
6. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
7. Complete the replication process
8. End the procedure.
