I'm sorry, but the updated statement "suppose less bees visit a flower happens, how will it affect more fish" does not seem to be related to the original procedure of fish laying eggs, hatching, and growing into adult fish. Can you please provide more context or information so I can better understand the task and provide an appropriate pseudocode?
