1. Deliver oxygen through blood
2. Break down proteins and acids in liver
3. Release urea waste from liver
4. Transport urea and carbon dioxide to kidneys through blood
5. Strain urea and salts from blood in kidneys
6. Transport carbon dioxide byproduct back to lungs through blood
7. Exhale carbon dioxide from lungs
8. If less food is being eaten, there will be less waste produced in the body
9. This may result in a decrease in the amount of urea and other waste products that are released by the liver
10. As a result, there may be less waste for the kidneys to filter out of the blood
11. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the amount of waste that is removed from the body.
