1. Evaporation:
   - Set initial water surface area
   - Set initial temperature
   - Set initial wind speed
   - While temperature and wind speed remain constant:
     - Calculate rate of evaporation based on surface area and temperature
     - Reduce water surface area by the amount of water evaporated
     - Output water vapor

2. Atmospheric Rise:
   - Set initial altitude
   - While water vapor is being output:
     - Increase altitude of water vapor
     - Output water vapor at new altitude

3. Condensation:
   - Set initial temperature and pressure
   - While water vapor is present:
     - Calculate rate of condensation based on temperature and pressure
     - Increase rate of condensation due to stasis
     - Reduce altitude of water vapor by the amount of water condensed
     - Output tiny particles of water/ice

4. Cloud/Fog Formation:
   - Set initial particle density
   - While particles are present:
     - Calculate rate of particle collision based on particle density and wind speed
     - Increase particle size and density based on collision rate
     - Output cloud/fog

5. Precipitation:
   - Set initial wind speed and temperature
   - While cloud/fog is present:
     - Calculate rate of precipitation based on wind speed and temperature
     - Reduce particle size and density by the amount of precipitation
     - Output rain/snow

6. Surface Water Collection:
   - Set initial surface area
   - While rain/snow is present:
     - Calculate rate of water collection based on surface area and precipitation
     - Increase surface water by the amount of water collected
     - Output surface water
