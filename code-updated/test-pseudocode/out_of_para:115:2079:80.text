1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, force it to the surface
8. Form volcano from magma.
9. Check for blooming flowers
10. If less flowers bloom, reduce erosion
11. Reduced erosion affects smaller mountains
12. Smaller mountains may not form or may erode faster if less flowers bloom.
