1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Break down water molecules using heat energy
7. If heat energy is less, molecules may break down slower
8. Allow molecules to escape from water
9. Water becomes vapor
10. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
