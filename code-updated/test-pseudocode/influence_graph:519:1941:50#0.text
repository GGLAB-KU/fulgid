1. Set fish as eggs
2. Hatch eggs
3. Emergence of larvae
4. Randomly select a percentage of larvae that will mature and grow
5. Maturation and growth of selected larvae
6. Development of adolescent fish (or fry)
7. Growth of adolescent fish
8. Check for sub-stages based on species or type
9. Maturation of fish into adult
10. Adult fish can lay more eggs.

Note: If fewer larvae mature and grow, it will result in fewer adolescent fish and ultimately fewer mature adults, which will lead to a decrease in the number of eggs laid.
