1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, force it to the surface
8. Check for land clearing activities
9. If land clearing occurs, assess impact on magma movement
10. If land clearing affects magma movement, adjust magma path towards cleared land
11. Form volcano from magma.
