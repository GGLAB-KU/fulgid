1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Check if there are cells present
3. If there are no cells present, end the procedure
4. If there are cells present, continue with the replication process
5. Break up the helix using chemicals
6. Split the helix into two strands
7. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
8. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
9. Complete the replication process
10. End the procedure.
