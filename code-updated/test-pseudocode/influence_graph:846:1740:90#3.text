1. Blood delivers oxygen in the body
2. Liver breaks down proteins and acids
3. Liver releases waste in the form of urea
4. Blood carries urea and carbon dioxide to the kidneys
5. Kidneys strain urea and salts needed from the blood
6. Carbon dioxide byproduct is transported back to the lungs
7. Lungs exhale carbon dioxide
8. Breathing occurs to take in oxygen
9. If breathing is insufficient, less oxygen is delivered to the body
