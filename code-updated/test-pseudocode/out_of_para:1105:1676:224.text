1. Begin procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
2. Set variable "pressure" to occur underground
3. Tectonic plates underground pull and stretch
4. Small cracks are formed in the earth's crust
5. The tectonic plates push hard against each other
6. Some parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground
7. If there is more water to heat:
8.    Increase the pressure underground
9.    Tectonic plates pull and stretch more forcefully
10.   Larger cracks are formed in the earth's crust
11.   The tectonic plates push even harder against each other
12.   Larger parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground, including larger mountains
13. End procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
