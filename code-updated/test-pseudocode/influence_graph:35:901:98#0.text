1. Input: Different kinds of rocks
2. Process: 
   a. Rocks melt into magma
   b. Magma is pushed under the surface with pressure
   c. Magma rises to the surface and becomes lava
   d. Lava cools
   e. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock
   f. Increased pressure may result in more magma being pushed to the surface, leading to more lava and igneous rock formation
3. Output: Igneous rock
