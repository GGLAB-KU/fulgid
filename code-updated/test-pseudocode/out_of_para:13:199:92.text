1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, and plants
2. Convert water source into water vapor
3. Condense water vapor into tiny droplets to form clouds
4. Release droplets from clouds through precipitation (rain or snow)
5. Absorb precipitation into the ground or run off into rivers
6. If absorbed into the ground, water is taken up by plants
7. Plants release water from their surfaces as vapor
8. Vapor goes back into the atmosphere
9. If water runs off into rivers, it flows into ponds, lakes, or oceans
10. Water evaporates back into the atmosphere
11. If bee hives are set up, increase the number of bees to pollinate plants
12. Increased pollination leads to more plant growth
13. More plant growth leads to more water absorption from the ground
14. More water absorption from the ground leads to more water vapor in the atmosphere
15. More water vapor in the atmosphere leads to more cloud formation
16. More cloud formation leads to more precipitation (rain or snow)
17. Increased precipitation leads to more water absorption into the ground or run off into rivers
18. Repeat steps 5-17 to continue the cycle.
