1. Set up a loop for tectonic plate movement
2. Check for collision between two plates
3. If collision occurs, crumple the edges of the plates
4. Convert the crumpled edges into mountain ranges
5. Check for magma movement towards the surface
6. If magma is forced to the surface, form a volcano.
7. If magma is pushed with pressure under the surface, check for stability of the surface
8. If the surface is stable, continue with the loop
9. If the surface is not stable, trigger an earthquake or other geological event to release the pressure and restore stability.
