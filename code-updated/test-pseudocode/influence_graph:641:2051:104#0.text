1. Initialize tadpole
2. While tadpole has no hind legs:
   a. Feed tadpole
   b. Monitor tadpole's growth
   c. If hind legs appear, go to step 3
3. While tadpole has a tail:
   a. Feed tadpole
   b. Monitor tadpole's growth
   c. If tail is lost, go to step 4
4. Initialize frog
5. While frog is alive:
   a. Feed frog
   b. Monitor frog's health
   c. If frog mates with another frog and the situation is favourable:
      i. Produce a limited number of offspring to avoid overpopulation
      ii. Release the offspring into a safe and suitable environment
      iii. Monitor the offspring's growth and health
   d. If the situation is not favourable, go to step 6
6. Initialize tadpole
7. Go to step 2

Note: The above pseudocode has been updated to include a check for the situation being favourable before producing offspring. If the situation is not favourable, the frogs will not mate and produce offspring, which will help to reduce the population and ensure that there are enough resources for the existing frogs. Additionally, a limit has been placed on the number of offspring produced to avoid overpopulation, and the offspring are released into a safe and suitable environment to increase their chances of survival.
