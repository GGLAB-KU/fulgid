1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Create upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
   d. If there are fewer upheavals:
      i. Form mountains from the existing upheavals
   e. If there is more of a techtonic shift:
      i. Increase the frequency of fissures and upheavals
3. End while loop.
