1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, rivers, swamps, and plants
2. Convert water from initial source into water vapor
3. Form water vapor into droplets to create clouds
4. Determine if droplets in clouds will become rain or snow
5. If droplets become rain or snow, allow them to fall
6. Some water will go into the ground
7. If more water goes into the ground, update the amount of water that flows down streams into rivers and oceans accordingly.
