1. Initialize variable "magma" to represent the amount of magma present
2. Bee lands on flower
3. Bee's feet slip into grooves holding pollen sacs
4. Bee flies off, carrying pollen sac
5. Bee lands on another plant
6. Pollen sac falls off and pollinates plant
7. If magma > 0, increase the number of flowers available for bees to land on
8. Repeat steps 2-6 for additional bees that can now reach the newly available flowers.
