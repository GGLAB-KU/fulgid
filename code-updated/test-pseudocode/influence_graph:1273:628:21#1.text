1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant.
3. When the insect or bird lands, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. If the insect is a bee, check if it is healthy.
5. If the bee is not healthy, do not rely on it to transfer pollen.
6. If the bee is healthy, allow it to collect pollen and transfer it to another plant of the same species.
7. If there are fewer healthy bees available, there may be a decrease in the amount of pollen being transferred between plants.
