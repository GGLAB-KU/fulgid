1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Trigger upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
   d. If upheavals in the crust occur:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
   e. If the surface is impermeable:
      i. Prevent water from seeping into the ground
      ii. Affect the growth of smaller mountains due to lack of water supply
4. End procedure.
