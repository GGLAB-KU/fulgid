1. Bee lands on flower
2. Bee's feet slip into grooves holding pollen sacs
3. Bee flies off, carrying pollen sac
4. Bee lands on another plant
5. Pollen sac falls off and pollinates plant
6. If flowers close to bee hives are moved:
   a. Bees may have to travel further to find flowers
   b. This may result in less flowers being pollinated
7. Therefore, it is important to consider the location of bee hives when moving flowers to ensure optimal pollination.
