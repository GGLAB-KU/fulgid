1. Begin procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
2. Set variable "pressure" to occur underground
3. If "less heat" happens underground, then decrease the value of "pressure"
4. Tectonic plates underground pull and stretch
5. Small cracks are formed in the earth's crust
6. The tectonic plates push hard against each other
7. If "pressure" is decreased, then the force of the plates pushing against each other will also decrease
8. Some parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground
9. If the force of the plates pushing against each other is decreased, then smaller mountains may form due to less movement of the earth's crust
10. End procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
