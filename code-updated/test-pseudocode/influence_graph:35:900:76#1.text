1. Input: Different kinds of rocks
2. Process: 
   a. Rocks melt into magma
   b. Magma rises to the surface and becomes lava in a volcano
   c. Lava cools
   d. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock
3. Output: Igneous rock formed from cooled magma and lava in a volcano. 

Note: The eruption of lava from a volcano can lead to the formation of more igneous rock due to the cooling and solidification of the lava on the Earth's surface.
