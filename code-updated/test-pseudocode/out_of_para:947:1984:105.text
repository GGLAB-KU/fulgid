1. Evaporation:
   - Set initial water surface area
   - Set initial temperature
   - Set initial wind speed
   - Set initial fry population
   - While temperature and wind speed remain constant:
     - Calculate rate of evaporation based on surface area and temperature
     - Reduce water surface area by the amount of water evaporated
     - Output water vapor
     - If fry population decreases:
       - Adjust evaporation rate based on new fry population

2. Atmospheric Rise:
   - Set initial altitude
   - While water vapor is being output:
     - Increase altitude of water vapor
     - Output water vapor at new altitude

3. Condensation:
   - Set initial temperature and pressure
   - While water vapor is rising:
     - Calculate rate of condensation based on temperature and pressure
     - Convert water vapor to tiny particles of water/ice
     - Output particles of water/ice

4. Cloud/Fog Formation:
   - Set initial particle density
   - While particles of water/ice are being output:
     - Increase particle density
     - Combine particles of water/ice into clouds or fog
     - Output clouds or fog

5. Precipitation:
   - Set initial wind speed and temperature
   - Set initial adult fish population
   - While clouds or fog are present:
     - Calculate rate of precipitation based on wind speed and temperature
     - Convert particles of water/ice to rain/snow
     - Output rain/snow
     - If adult fish population decreases:
       - Adjust precipitation rate based on new adult fish population

6. Surface Water Collection:
   - Set initial surface area
   - While rain/snow is falling:
     - Collect fallen rain/snow into surface water
     - Increase surface area of water
     - Output surface water

7. Evaporation:
   - Repeat step 1 with new surface area, temperature, and fry/adult fish populations.
