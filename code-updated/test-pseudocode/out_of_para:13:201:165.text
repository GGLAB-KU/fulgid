1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, and plants
2. Convert water source into water vapor
3. Condense water vapor into tiny droplets to form clouds
4. Release droplets from clouds through precipitation (rain or snow)
5. Absorb precipitation into the ground or run off into rivers
6. If absorbed into the ground, water is taken up by plants
7. Plants release water from their surfaces as vapor
8. Vapor goes back into the atmosphere
9. If water runs off into rivers, it flows into ponds, lakes, or oceans
10. Water evaporates back into the atmosphere
11. Check if pollution is affecting the ability of fish to lay eggs
12. If fish cannot lay eggs due to pollution, reduce the size of the ocean
13. Repeat steps 2-12 until the desired time frame is reached.
