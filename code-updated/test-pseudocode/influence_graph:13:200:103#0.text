1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, and plants
2. Convert water source into water vapor
3. Condense water vapor into tiny droplets to form clouds
4. Release droplets from clouds through precipitation (rain or snow)
5. Absorb precipitation into the ground or run off into rivers
6. If absorbed into the ground, water is taken up by plants
7. Plants release water from their surfaces as vapor
8. Vapor goes back into the atmosphere
9. If less water vapor goes back into the atmosphere, the water cycle may become less intense
10. This could result in less precipitation and less water being absorbed into the ground or running off into rivers
11. It could also lead to less water being taken up by plants and less water evaporating back into the atmosphere
12. Ultimately, this could have significant impacts on ecosystems and human societies that rely on water for survival.
