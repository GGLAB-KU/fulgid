1. Set volcano = true
2. Set magma = hot
3. Set crops = better and stronger
4. While volcano is true:
   a. Magma rises towards surface of volcano
   b. Magma cools
   c. If magma is released from volcano:
      i. Set magma = lava
      ii. Lava cools and solidifies into hard rock
   d. Magma starts to harden as it cools
   e. If crops are better and stronger:
      i. More nutrients are available in the soil
      ii. Plants absorb more minerals from the soil
      iii. More minerals are released into the soil as plants decompose
      iv. More minerals are available for igneous rock formation
4. End procedure.
