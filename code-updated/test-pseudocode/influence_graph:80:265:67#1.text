1. Rubbing of tectonic plates
2. Crumbling of rocks around the cracks
3. Earthquake occurs
4. Large force of earthquake
5. Rocks pushed up out of earth by force
6. Rocks become volcanos
7. Volcanos erupt many times
8. Size of rocky area grows
9. Volcano becomes dormant
10. Volcano and its eruptions become a mountain
11. If more tectonic plates rub against each other, the force of the earthquake may increase
12. Increased force may cause smaller mountains to crumble or change in shape
13. The size and shape of the mountain may be affected by the continued movement of tectonic plates.
