1. Adult frog spawns eggs in water
2. Eggs hatch into tadpoles
3. Tadpoles live in water and grow
4. Tadpoles develop external gills and longer tail
5. Tadpole stores food in tail
6. Tadpole develops hind legs and lives off stored food in tail
7. If climate is very temperate:
   - Tadpole may develop faster or slower than usual
   - Tadpole may be more or less susceptible to disease
   - Tadpole may have different food requirements
8. If FrontLegsAppear():
   - ShortenTail()
   - LookLikeYoungFrog()
9. Young frog continues to grow to adulthood. 

Pseudocode:

1. SpawnEggsInWater()
2. HatchEggsIntoTadpoles()
3. While Tadpoles are alive:
   - GrowTadpoles()
   - DevelopExternalGillsAndLongerTail()
   - StoreFoodInTail()
   - DevelopHindLegsAndLiveOffStoredFood()
   - If ClimateIsVeryTemperate():
     - DevelopFasterOrSlower()
     - BeMoreOrLessSusceptibleToDisease()
     - HaveDifferentFoodRequirements()
   - If FrontLegsAppear():
     - ShortenTail()
     - LookLikeYoungFrog()
4. ContinueGrowingToAdulthood()
