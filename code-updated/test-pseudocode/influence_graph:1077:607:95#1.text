1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Check if helixes are seeking out new pairs
3. If helixes are seeking out new pairs, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 6.
4. Stop the helixes from seeking out new pairs
5. Repair any damage caused by the helixes seeking out new pairs
6. Break up the helix using chemicals
7. Split the helix into two strands
8. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
9. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
10. Complete the replication process
11. End the procedure.
