1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, force it to the surface
8. Form volcano from magma
9. Check for oil spill near the pond
10. If oil spill occurs, assess the impact on the surrounding environment
11. Determine if the spill will affect the larger mountains
12. If spill affects the larger mountains, assess the potential damage to the tectonic plates
13. Adjust the movement of the plates accordingly to account for the potential damage.
