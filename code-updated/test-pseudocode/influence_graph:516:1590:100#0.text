1. If there are fewer adult frogs, there will be fewer eggs laid in the water.
2. The number of tadpoles hatching from the eggs will be reduced.
3. Tadpoles may have to compete for resources in the water due to the reduced population.
4. Tadpoles may not have enough food to store in their tails, which could affect their growth and development.
5. The development of hind legs and front legs may be delayed or stunted due to lack of resources.
6. The survival rate of tadpoles and young frogs may decrease due to the reduced population and competition for resources.
7. The overall population of frogs may decline if there are not enough adult frogs to reproduce and maintain the population.
