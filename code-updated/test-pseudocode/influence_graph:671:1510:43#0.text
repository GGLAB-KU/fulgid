1. Input: Liquid
2. Heat Liquid from external source
3. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
4. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
5. Increase in temperature of Liquid
6. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
7. If temperature has reached boiling point, change state of Liquid to Gas
8. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
9. Check if all Liquid has turned to Gas
10. If all Liquid has turned to Gas, Evaporation is complete
11. If more energy is absorbed by molecules, more molecules will go into gaseous state
12. Output: No Liquid left behind
