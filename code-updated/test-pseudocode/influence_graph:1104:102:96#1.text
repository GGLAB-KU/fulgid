1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Trigger upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
      iii. If lava chambers are aggravated with build-up pressure:
          1. Increase the likelihood of volcanic eruptions
   d. If upheavals in the crust occur:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
   e. If lava chambers are empty:
      i. Decrease the likelihood of volcanic eruptions
3. End procedure.
