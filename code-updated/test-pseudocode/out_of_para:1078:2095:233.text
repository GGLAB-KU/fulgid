I'm sorry, but the proposed pseudocode is not related to the given statement. The given statement is about the effect of heat on DNA replication. Therefore, a new pseudocode cannot be created based on the given statement. However, I can provide a pseudocode for the process of DNA replication that includes the effect of heat on the process:

1. Initiate DNA replication with proteins
2. If heat occurs underground:
   a. Check if the temperature is within the optimal range for DNA replication
   b. If the temperature is too high, stop the replication process
   c. If the temperature is within the optimal range, continue with the replication process
3. Break hydrogen bonds holding DNA strand together
4. For each side of the strand:
   a. Read the strand with a polymerase
   b. Add complimentary nucleotides
   c. Match all bases
   d. Form a new DNA strand
5. Seal new pieces into two new strands with DNA ligase.
