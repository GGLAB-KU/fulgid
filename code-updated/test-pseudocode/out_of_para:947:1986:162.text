1. Evaporation:
   - Set initial water surface area
   - Set initial temperature
   - Set initial wind speed
   - Set initial predator population
   - While temperature, wind speed, and predator population are constant:
     - Increase water surface area
     - Calculate amount of water evaporated based on temperature, wind speed, and predator population
     - Convert evaporated water into water vapor
     - Move water vapor into atmosphere

2. Condensation:
   - Set initial atmospheric conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity)
   - Set initial predator population
   - While atmospheric conditions and predator population are constant:
     - Water vapor in atmosphere cools and condenses into tiny particles of water/ice
     - If predator population is lower, more condensation occurs due to less disturbance in the ecosystem
     - Particles of water/ice combine to form clouds or fog

3. Precipitation:
   - Set initial atmospheric conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity)
   - Set initial predator population
   - While atmospheric conditions and predator population are constant:
     - Changes in wind speed or temperature cause clouds to move
     - When clouds reach a certain altitude or temperature, precipitation occurs
     - Precipitation can be rain or snow depending on temperature

4. Collection:
   - Fallen rain or snow collects into surface water (rivers, lakes, oceans)
   - Surface water evaporates into water vapor again, restarting the cycle.
