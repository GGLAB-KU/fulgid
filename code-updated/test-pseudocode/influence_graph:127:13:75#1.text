1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Break down water molecules using heat energy
7. Check the duration of heat application
8. If heat application is short, proceed to step 9
9. Allow molecules to escape from water
10. Water becomes vapor
11. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
12. If heat application is long, proceed to step 13
13. Fewer molecules will be broken down
14. Allow molecules to escape from water
15. Water becomes vapor
16. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
