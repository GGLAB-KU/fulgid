1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant.
3. When the insect or bird lands on the plant, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. The insect or bird travels to another plant of the same species.
5. When the insect or bird lands on the new plant, the pollen is transferred to the new plant.
6. If humans concrete over the plants, there will be fewer plants available for insects to land on.
7. This could lead to a decrease in the insect population, which could have negative effects on the ecosystem.
8. Alternatively, if there are fewer plants available, the remaining plants may receive more attention from insects, leading to an increase in pollination and potentially an increase in the plant population.
