1. Input: Liquid
2. Heat Liquid from external source
3. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
4. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
5. Increase in temperature of Liquid
6. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
7. If temperature has reached boiling point, change Liquid to gas state
8. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
9. Check if all Liquid has turned to gas
10. If all Liquid has turned to gas, evaporation is complete
11. If heat decreases in intensity, molecules will move around at a slower pace
12. Decrease heat intensity
13. Repeat steps 3-11 until all Liquid has evaporated or heat source is turned off
14. Output: No Liquid left behind
