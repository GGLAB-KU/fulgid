1. Input: Different kinds of rocks, availability of land
2. Process: 
   a. If more land is available, it may lead to less volcanic activity and therefore less igneous rock formation
   b. Rocks melt into magma
   c. Magma cools in the crust
   d. Magma rises to the surface and becomes lava
   e. Lava cools
   f. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock
3. Output: Igneous rock formation may be affected by the availability of land.
