1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
7. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to resemble a frog
8. If changes in tides occur, check if the water level is too high or too low for the tadpoles to survive
9. If the water level is too high, move the tadpoles to a higher location
10. If the water level is too low, move the tadpoles to a lower location with more water
11. Monitor the tadpoles closely to ensure their survival
12. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "complete"
13. If there are fewer frogs than expected, investigate the cause and take necessary actions to prevent further decline in the frog population.
