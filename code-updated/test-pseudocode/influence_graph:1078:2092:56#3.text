I'm sorry, but the proposed pseudocode is not related to the given scenario. However, I can provide a new pseudocode based on the given scenario:

1. Check if amputation has occurred
2. If amputation has occurred, identify the affected DNA strand
3. Determine the number of less pairings of A-T and G-C on the affected strand
4. Initiate DNA replication with proteins
5. Break hydrogen bonds holding DNA strand together
6. Read each side of the strand with a polymerase
7. Add complimentary nucleotides to each side, taking into account the less pairings of A-T and G-C
8. Match all bases on each side
9. Form new DNA strand
10. Seal new pieces into two new strands with DNA ligase.
