1. Get water from a lake or ocean
2. Check if there is enough heat to cause evaporation
3. If there is enough heat, evaporate the water
4. Allow the water vapor to enter the atmosphere
5. Accumulate the water vapor in the atmosphere
6. Form clouds from the accumulated water vapor
7. Check if the clouds become too heavy
8. If the clouds become too heavy, initiate precipitation
9. If there is not enough heat to cause evaporation, skip steps 3-8
10. End procedure.
