1. Evaporation:
   - Set initial water surface area
   - Set initial temperature
   - Set initial wind speed
   - While temperature and wind speed remain constant:
     - Calculate rate of evaporation based on surface area and temperature
     - Convert water to water vapor
     - Increase water vapor concentration in atmosphere
2. Condensation:
   - When water vapor concentration reaches a certain level:
     - Convert water vapor to tiny particles of water/ice
     - Form particles together into clouds or fog
3. Precipitation:
   - When wind/temperature changes:
     - Determine if precipitation will occur as rain or snow
     - Release precipitation from clouds/fog
     - Collect fallen rain or snow into surface water
4. Evaporation:
   - Repeat step 1 to start the cycle again.
5. Intensification:
   - If more time occurs:
     - Increase the rate of evaporation
     - Increase the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere
     - Increase the frequency and intensity of precipitation events
     - Increase the amount of surface water collected
     - Repeat the cycle with the new parameters to create a more intense water cycle.
