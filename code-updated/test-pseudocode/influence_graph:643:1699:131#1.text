1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
7. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to resemble a frog
8. If more tadpoles survive, there will be more competition for resources
9. This may result in fewer resources available for each tadpole, potentially leading to a smaller size or slower growth rate
10. If tadpoles are smaller or grow more slowly, they may be more vulnerable to predators or less likely to survive to become frogs
11. Therefore, if more tadpoles survive, it may result in fewer frogs overall.
