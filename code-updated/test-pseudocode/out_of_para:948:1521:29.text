1. Set initial amount of water on earth
2. Set initial number of predators
3. While there is water on earth:
   a. Water evaporates from the earth
   b. The evaporated water condenses into water drops
   c. The water drops fall back to earth
   d. The water accumulates on the earth
   e. The water collects into bodies of water
   f. The water soaks into the earth
   g. If the number of predators increases:
      i. More frogs are eaten by predators
      ii. The frog population decreases
      iii. With fewer frogs, there is less water absorbed by their skin
      iv. The water cycle becomes more intense
   h. Update the amount of water on earth
   i. Update the number of predators
4. End while loop.
