1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"

4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
7. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to resemble a frog
8. If there are less animals that hunt frogs, increase the probability of tadpole survival
9. If more tadpoles survive, there will be more frogs in the population
10. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "complete"
