1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Check for cloud formation
3. If less clouds form, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, wait for suitable cloud formation.
4. Break up the helix using chemicals
5. Split the helix into two strands
6. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
7. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
8. Complete the replication process
9. Cell replicates with the newly formed DNA strands.
