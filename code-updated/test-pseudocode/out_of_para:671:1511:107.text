1. Input: Liquid
2. Heat Liquid from external source
3. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
4. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
5. Increase in temperature of Liquid
6. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
7. If temperature has reached boiling point, change Liquid to gas state
8. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
9. Check if all Liquid has turned to gas
10. If all Liquid has turned to gas, evaporation is complete
11. If surface is not movable, continue heating Liquid to increase temperature and energy of molecules
12. If surface is not movable, the rate of evaporation may be slower due to the lack of movement and circulation of air around the Liquid
13. Output: No Liquid left behind, but evaporation rate may be affected by immovable surface.
