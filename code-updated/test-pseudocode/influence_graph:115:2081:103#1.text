1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, force it to the surface
8. If no magma present, skip step 7 and 8
9. Evaluate the size of the mountain range based on the extent of crumpling
10. If no volcano formed, evaluate the size of the mountain range based on the extent of crumpling
11. If no magma present, the size of the mountain range will be limited by the extent of crumpling and the absence of volcanic activity.
