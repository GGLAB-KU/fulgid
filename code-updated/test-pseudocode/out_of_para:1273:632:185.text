1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant.
3. When the insect or bird lands, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. The insect or bird travels to another plant of the same species.
5. The pollen is transferred from the insect or bird to the new plant.
6. If more eggs are incubated, there will be more insects or birds available for pollination.
7. Therefore, more flowers will be pollinated as a result of the increased number of pollinators.
