1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Trigger upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
   d. If upheavals in the crust occur:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
   e. If the earth adjusts the plates without crashing:
      i. Check for existing mountains
      ii. If mountains exist:
          1. Determine the impact of the plate adjustment on the mountains
          2. Adjust the mountains accordingly
3. End procedure.
