1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, continue cooling
5. If water temperature is above 32 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Heat breaks down water molecules
7. Water molecules escape from the water
8. Water becomes vapor
9. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
10. If water temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, continue cooling
11. Water molecules slow down due to freezing temperatures
12. Collisions between water molecules decrease due to slower movement
13. Freezing water molecules may form a crystalline structure
14. Water may expand as it freezes, potentially causing damage to container or surroundings.
