1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Break down water molecules using heat energy
7. Allow molecules to escape from water
8. Check for disease amongst fish population
9. If disease is present, proceed to step 10
10. Disease may cause fish to die and decompose, releasing organic matter into the water
11. Organic matter may increase the water's temperature and decrease its oxygen levels, leading to more evaporation
12. Water becomes vapor
13. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
