1. Set up a container of water.
2. Shield the container of water from a heat source, such as sunlight.
3. Continuously monitor the temperature of the water.
4. If the temperature of the water does not rise above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue to the next step. Otherwise, continue monitoring the temperature.
5. Apply heat energy to the water until the molecules begin to break down.
6. Monitor the water for the presence of escaping molecules.
7. As molecules escape from the water, the water will become vapor.
8. Continue heating the water until all of the water has turned into vapor.
9. The vapor will evaporate into the atmosphere.
