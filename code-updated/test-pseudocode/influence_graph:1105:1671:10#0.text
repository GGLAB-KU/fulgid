1. Begin procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
2. Set variable "pressure" to occur underground
3. If "pressure" increases, then tectonic plates push harder against each other
4. Tectonic plates underground pull and stretch
5. Small cracks are formed in the earth's crust
6. The tectonic plates push hard against each other
7. Some parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground
8. End procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
