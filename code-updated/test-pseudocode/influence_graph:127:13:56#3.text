1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Heat breaks down water molecules
7. Water molecules escape from the water
8. Water becomes vapor
9. If water is not protected from high heat, continue heating
10. More vapor will form as a result of continued heating
11. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
