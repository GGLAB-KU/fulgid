1. Check for the availability of sufficient DNA for replication
2. If there is less DNA available, proceed to step 3, else proceed to step 4
3. Reduce the replication rate to prevent damage to the DNA
4. Initiate DNA replication with proteins
5. Break hydrogen bonds holding DNA strand together
6. Read each side of the strand with a polymerase
7. Add complimentary nucleotides to each side
8. Match all bases on each side
9. Form new DNA strand
10. Seal new pieces into two new strands with DNA ligase.
