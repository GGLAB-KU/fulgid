1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Break down water molecules using heat energy
7. Allow molecules to escape from water
8. Water becomes vapor
9. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
10. If the vapor is in a confined space with a person, it may increase humidity and make sweating less effective in cooling the body.
