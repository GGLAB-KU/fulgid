1. Begin procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
2. Set variable "pressure" to occur underground
3. If pressure under the surface is built up, then
4. Tectonic plates underground pull and stretch
5. Small cracks are formed in the earth's crust
6. The tectonic plates push hard against each other
7. Some parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground, which can cause larger mountains to form
8. End procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
