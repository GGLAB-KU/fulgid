1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Create upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
   d. If upheavals exist:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
   e. If a lot of time has passed:
      i. Apply erosion to the mountains
      ii. Monitor the effects of erosion on the mountains
3. End while loop.
