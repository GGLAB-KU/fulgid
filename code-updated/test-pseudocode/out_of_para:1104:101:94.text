1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Create upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
          3. If magma turns into lava:
             a. Push the crust upward
   d. If upheavals exist:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
3. End while loop.
