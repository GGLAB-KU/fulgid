1. Blood delivers oxygen in the body
2. Liver breaks down proteins and acids
3. Liver releases waste in the form of urea
4. Blood carries urea and carbon dioxide to the kidneys
5. Kidneys strain urea and salts needed from the blood
6. Carbon dioxide byproduct is transported back to the lungs
7. Lungs exhale carbon dioxide
8. During suffocation, gas exchange is affected
9. Less oxygen is delivered to the body
10. Carbon dioxide accumulates in the blood
11. Liver may not be able to break down proteins and acids effectively due to lack of oxygen
12. Kidneys may not be able to strain urea and salts effectively due to lack of oxygen
13. Carbon dioxide byproduct may not be transported back to the lungs effectively due to lack of oxygen
14. Gas exchange may be compromised, leading to potential health issues.
