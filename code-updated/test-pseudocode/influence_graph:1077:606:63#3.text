1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Break up the helix using chemicals
3. Split the helix into multiple strands
4. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA helix
5. Form the new DNA helixes by pairing complementary nucleotides
6. Check that all helixes are intact and complete
7. Complete the replication process
8. End the procedure.
