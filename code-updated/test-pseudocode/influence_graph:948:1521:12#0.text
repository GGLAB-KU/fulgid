1. Set initial amount of water on earth
2. Set initial location to desert
3. While there is water on earth:
   a. If location is desert:
      i. Water evaporates from the earth at a faster rate
      ii. The evaporated water condenses into water drops
      iii. The water drops fall back to earth at a slower rate
      iv. The water accumulates on the earth at a slower rate
      v. The water collects into bodies of water at a slower rate
      vi. The water soaks into the earth at a slower rate
   b. Else:
      i. Water evaporates from the earth
      ii. The evaporated water condenses into water drops
      iii. The water drops fall back to earth
      iv. The water accumulates on the earth
      v. The water collects into bodies of water
      vi. The water soaks into the earth
4. End loop
