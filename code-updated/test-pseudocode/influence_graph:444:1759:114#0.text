1. Bee lands on flower
2. Bee's leg hairs attach to pollen sacs from stamens of flower
3. Bee flies away with pollen
4. Bee lands on new flower
5. Pollen sacs are rubbed off onto stigma of new flower
6. If bee predators increase:
   a. Less bees will be available to pollinate flowers
   b. Less flowers will be pollinated
   c. This may lead to a decrease in plant reproduction and biodiversity.
