1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators, including fish
5. If fish eat more frogs, increase the likelihood of tadpoles losing their tails as a survival mechanism
6. Tadpole grows larger over time
7. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it may lose its tail earlier than expected due to increased predation pressure
8. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to move on land
9. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "formed"
