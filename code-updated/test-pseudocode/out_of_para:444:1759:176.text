I'm sorry, but the statement "suppose more evaporation of water happens, how will it affect more bees land on flowers" does not seem to be directly related to the procedure of bees gathering nectar and pollen from flowers. Therefore, I cannot provide an updated pseudocode based on this statement. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?
