1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. Initialize asteroid strike variable to false
3. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. If asteroid strike variable is true:
      i. Decrease the frequency of crust upheavals
   c. Else, trigger upheavals in the crust
   d. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
   e. If upheavals in the crust occur:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
   f. If asteroid strike happens:
      i. Set asteroid strike variable to true
4. End procedure.
