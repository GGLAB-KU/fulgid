1. Input: 
   a. Different kinds of rocks
   b. Humid climates
   c. Seeds
2. Process:
   a. If humid climates provide water to the seeds,
      i. Then the seeds will grow into plants
      ii. The plants will absorb water and nutrients from the soil
      iii. The roots of the plants will penetrate the rocks
      iv. The rocks will undergo weathering and erosion
      v. The broken down rocks will form sediment
      vi. The sediment will be transported and deposited
      vii. The sediment will undergo compaction and cementation
      viii. Sedimentary rocks will form instead of igneous rocks
   b. If humid climates do not provide water to the seeds,
      i. Then the rocks will not undergo weathering and erosion
      ii. The rocks will remain as igneous rocks
3. Output: Sedimentary rocks or igneous rocks depending on the presence or absence of water provided by humid climates to the seeds.
