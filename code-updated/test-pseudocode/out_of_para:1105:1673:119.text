1. Begin procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
2. Set variable "pressure" to occur underground
3. Tectonic plates underground pull and stretch
4. Small cracks are formed in the earth's crust
5. Tectonic plates push hard against each other
6. If less igneous rock forms:
   7. Decrease the amount of magma that rises to the surface
   8. Decrease the amount of volcanic activity
   9. Decrease the amount of uplift
7. End if
8. Some parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground to form smaller mountains
9. End procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
