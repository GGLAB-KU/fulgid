1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, and plants
2. Convert water source into water vapor
3. Condense water vapor into tiny droplets to form clouds
4. Release droplets from clouds through precipitation (rain or snow)
5. If less sunny days occur:
   a. Increase the likelihood of more precipitation (rain or snow)
6. Absorb precipitation into the ground or run off into rivers
7. If absorbed into the ground, water is taken up by plants
8. Plants release water from their surfaces as vapor
9. Vapor goes back into the atmosphere
10. If water runs off into rivers, it flows into ponds, lakes, or oceans
11. Water evaporates back into the atmosphere.
