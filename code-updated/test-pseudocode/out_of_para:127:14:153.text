1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Heat breaks down water molecules
7. Water molecules escape from the water
8. Water becomes vapor
9. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
10. If more urine is added to the water, the water level will increase
11. The increased water level may reduce the surface area of the water exposed to heat energy
12. This may result in less evaporation of the water and urine mixture
13. Check water temperature and repeat steps 4-9 as necessary.
