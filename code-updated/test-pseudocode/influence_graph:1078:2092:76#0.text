1. Initiate DNA replication with proteins
2. Check for sufficient enzymes to ensure proper replication
3. If there are less enzymes than required, proceed to step 4, else continue with step 5
4. Notify the system of insufficient enzymes and halt replication process
5. Break hydrogen bonds holding DNA strand together
6. Read each side of the strand with a polymerase
7. Add complimentary nucleotides to each side
8. Match all bases on each side
9. Form new DNA strand
10. Seal new pieces into two new strands with DNA ligase.
