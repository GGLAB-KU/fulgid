1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. If less fish eat frogs, increase the probability of tadpoles surviving to develop limbs
7. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
8. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to move on land
9. If more tadpoles develop limbs, increase the probability of a successful transition to a frog
10. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "formed"
