1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. If water dries up before tadpole develops limbs, set tadpole variable as "died"
7. If tadpole develops limbs, it becomes a frog
8. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "formed"
9. If water dries up before tadpole becomes a frog, set frog variable as "died"
10. Count the number of tadpoles that died and the number of frogs that formed to determine the impact on the frog population.
