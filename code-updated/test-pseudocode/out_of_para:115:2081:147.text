1. Set up a loop for tectonic plate movement
2. Check for collision between two plates
3. If collision occurs, crumple the edges of the plates
4. Convert the crumpled edges into mountain ranges
5. Check for magma movement towards the surface
6. If magma is forced to the surface, form a volcano.
7. Check for favorable weather conditions for bees
8. If favorable weather conditions exist, increase the bee population
9. Increase bee activity in pollinating plants
10. Increase plant growth and stability
11. Increase soil stability and erosion control
12. As a result, larger mountains may experience less erosion and maintain their size and shape over time.
