1. Set initial water source as oceans, rivers, swamps, and plants
2. If lakes are not dry, include lakes as an initial water source
3. Convert water from initial source into water vapor
4. Form water vapor into droplets to create clouds
5. Determine if droplets in clouds will become rain or snow
6. If droplets become rain or snow, allow them to fall
7. Some water will go into the ground
8. Some water will flow down streams into rivers and oceans
9. If lakes are dry, remove lakes as an initial water source
10. If lakes are dry, the flow of water may decrease in streams and rivers that were previously fed by the lakes.
