Assuming that no time has passed, a more intense water cycle would require changes to the initial conditions of the system. Here is an updated pseudocode representation:

1. Evaporation:
   - Set initial water surface area (larger than before)
   - Set initial temperature (higher than before)
   - Set initial wind speed (stronger than before)
   - While temperature and wind speed remain constant:
     - Calculate rate of evaporation based on surface area and temperature
     - Convert water to water vapor
     - Increase water vapor concentration in atmosphere
2. Condensation:
   - When water vapor concentration reaches a certain level:
     - Convert water vapor to tiny particles of water/ice
     - Form particles together into clouds or fog
3. Precipitation:
   - When wind/temperature changes:
     - Determine if precipitation will occur as rain or snow
     - Release precipitation from clouds/fog
     - Collect fallen rain or snow into surface water
4. Evaporation:
   - Repeat step 1 to start the cycle again. 

Note: This updated pseudocode assumes that the system is in equilibrium and that no external factors are affecting the water cycle. In reality, changes to the water cycle may take time to occur and may be influenced by a variety of factors such as climate change, land use, and human activity.
