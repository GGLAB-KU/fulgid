1. Procedure: Frog Life Cycle and Environmental Impact
2. Input: Hurricane impact on frogs and environment
3. Output: Estimated impact on frog population
4. Begin
5.   If hurricane impact on frog population is significant then
6.     Reduce the number of eggs laid by frogs
7.     Egg clusters may not survive due to environmental damage
8.     Tadpoles with gills may not hatch from the eggs
9.     Tadpoles may not survive due to water pollution or destruction of their habitat
10.    Froglet survival rate may decrease due to lack of food or shelter
11.    Frog population may decrease significantly
12.  Else
13.    Follow the normal frog life cycle as described in the previous pseudocode
14.  End If
15.  Output estimated impact on frog population
16. End Procedure
