1. Set volcano = true
2. Set magma = hot
3. Set eggs_laid = 0
4. While volcano is true:
   a. Magma rises towards surface of volcano
   b. Magma cools
   c. If eggs_laid > 0:
      i. Set magma = more_hot
   d. If magma is released from volcano:
      i. Set magma = lava
      ii. Lava cools and solidifies into hard rock
      iii. Increment eggs_laid by 1
   e. Magma starts to harden as it cools
4. End procedure.
