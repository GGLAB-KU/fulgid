1. Initialize techtonic plates in the earth's crust
2. While techtonic plates move:
   a. Create fissures in the crust
   b. Create upheavals in the crust
   c. If fissures exist:
      i. Allow lava to erupt into volcanoes at the surface
      ii. If volcanoes erupt:
          1. Accumulate lava
          2. Form mountains
   d. If upheavals exist:
      i. Form mountains from the upheavals
   e. If the crust isn't cooled:
      i. Increase the likelihood of larger mountains forming due to the increased heat and pressure
      ii. Monitor the situation for potential hazards such as increased volcanic activity or earthquakes
4. End while loop.
