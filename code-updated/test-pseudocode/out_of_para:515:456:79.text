6. If a massive change in the crust occurs:
   a. Evaluate the impact on the water habitat of the frogs
   b. Determine if the water habitat is still suitable for the frogs
   c. If the water habitat is no longer suitable:
      i. Assess the ability of the frogs to adapt to a new habitat
      ii. Determine if there are alternative habitats available for the frogs
      iii. If there are no suitable habitats available, the frog population may decrease
7. Frogs leave the water
