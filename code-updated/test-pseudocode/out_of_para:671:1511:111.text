1. Input: Liquid, Regular Pressure
2. Heat Liquid from external source
3. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
4. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
5. Increase in temperature of Liquid
6. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
7. If temperature has reached boiling point, check if Regular Pressure is maintained
8. If Regular Pressure is maintained, change Liquid to gas state
9. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
10. Check if all Liquid has turned to gas
11. If all Liquid has turned to gas, evaporation is complete
12. Output: No Liquid left behind, Regular Pressure maintained, Less Evaporation due to Regular Pressure.
