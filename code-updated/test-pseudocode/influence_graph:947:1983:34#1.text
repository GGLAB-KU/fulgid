1. Set initial surface water level
2. Evaporate water from surface
3. Convert evaporated water into water vapor
4. Water vapor rises into atmosphere
5. Monitor temperature and wind conditions
6. If temperature and wind conditions are favorable, condensation occurs
7. Water vapor turns into tiny particles of water/ice
8. Tiny particles of water/ice form together into clouds or fog
9. Monitor temperature and wind conditions
10. If temperature and wind conditions are favorable, precipitation occurs
11. Check the size of the precipitation drops
12. If the drops are too small to reach the surface, return to step 9
13. Rain or snow falls to the surface
14. Collect fallen rain or snow into surface water
15. Repeat steps 2-14 until desired end condition is met.
