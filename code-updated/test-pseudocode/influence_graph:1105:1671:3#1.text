1. Begin procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
2. Set variable "pressure" to occur underground
3. If "pressure" is not occurring, set "pressure" to a default value
4. Tectonic plates underground pull and stretch
5. Small cracks are formed in the earth's crust
6. Tectonic plates push hard against each other
7. If "pressure" is not occurring, increase the force of tectonic plates pushing against each other
8. Some parts of the earth's crust move up high above the ground
9. End procedure "Tectonic Plate Movement"
