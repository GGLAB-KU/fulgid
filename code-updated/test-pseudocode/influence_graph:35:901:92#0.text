1. Input: 
   a. Different kinds of rocks
   b. Movement in the ocean
2. Process: 
   a. Rocks melt into magma
   b. Magma cools in the crust
   c. Magma rises to the surface and becomes lava
   d. Lava cools
   e. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock
   f. Movement in the ocean can cause tectonic activity, which can create more opportunities for magma to rise to the surface and form igneous rock
3. Output: Igneous rock formation can be influenced by movement in the ocean through tectonic activity.
