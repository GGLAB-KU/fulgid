1. Deliver oxygen through blood
2. Break down proteins and acids in liver
3. Release urea waste from liver
4. Transport urea and carbon dioxide to kidneys through blood
5. Strain urea and salts from blood in kidneys
6. Transport carbon dioxide byproduct back to lungs through blood
7. Exhale carbon dioxide from lungs
8. If more toxic pollutants enter the water:
   a. Liver may be affected
   b. Proteins and acids may be impacted
   c. The liver's ability to break down proteins and acids may be compromised
   d. The release of urea waste may be affected
   e. The kidneys may have to work harder to strain the blood
   f. The overall process may be disrupted or slowed down.
