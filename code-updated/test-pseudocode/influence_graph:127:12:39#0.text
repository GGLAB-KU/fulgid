1. Set up a container of water.
2. Expose the container of water to a heat source, such as sunlight.
3. Continuously monitor the temperature of the water.
4. If the temperature of the water rises above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue to the next step. Otherwise, continue monitoring the temperature.
5. Apply heat energy to the water until the molecules begin to break down.
6. Monitor the water for the presence of escaping molecules.
7. As molecules escape from the water, the water will become vapor.
8. If the water reaches its boiling point, continue to apply heat energy to the water to increase the rate of evaporation.
9. Continue to apply heat energy until all of the water has evaporated into the atmosphere.
