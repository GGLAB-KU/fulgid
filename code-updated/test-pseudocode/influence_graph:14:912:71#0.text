1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, rivers, swamps, and plants
2. Convert water from initial source into water vapor
3. Form water vapor into droplets to create clouds
4. Determine if droplets in clouds will become rain or snow
5. If droplets become rain or snow, allow them to fall
6. If less water droplets in clouds become rain or snow and fall, then:
   a. The amount of water that goes into the ground will decrease
   b. The amount of water that flows down streams into rivers and oceans will decrease
   c. The water cycle will become less intense.
