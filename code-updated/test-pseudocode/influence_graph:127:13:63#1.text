1. Set water in a container
2. Check if container is shielded from heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. If container is shielded from heat energy, proceed to step 10
4. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
5. Check water temperature
6. If water temperature is below 212 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
7. If water temperature is above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 8
8. Heat breaks down water molecules
9. Water molecules escape from the water
10. Water becomes vapor
11. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
