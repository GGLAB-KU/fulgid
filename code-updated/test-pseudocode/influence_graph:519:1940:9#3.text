1. Set fish as eggs
2. Hatch eggs
3. Emergence of larvae
4. Maturation and growth of larvae
5. Development of adolescent fish (or fry)
6. Growth of adolescent fish
7. Check for sub-stages based on species or type
8. Maturation of fish into adult
9. Check for predators preying on the fish
10. If more predators are preying on the fish, reduce the number of mature adults
11. If fewer mature adults, fewer eggs will be laid
12. If fewer eggs are laid, fewer fish will hatch
13. Repeat steps 3-12 until the predator population is controlled or the fish population is depleted.
