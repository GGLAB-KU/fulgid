1. Bee visits flower
2. Bee collects pollen on leg hairs
3. Bee moves to different flower
4. Some pollen falls off bee
5. Flower is pollinated
6. If tectonic plates crash on the surface, it may cause changes in the environment
7. These changes may affect the availability of flowers for bees to visit
8. If there are fewer flowers available, it may reduce the number of flowers that can be pollinated by bees
9. Conversely, if there are more flowers available due to the changes caused by tectonic plate activity, it may increase the number of flowers that can be pollinated by bees.
