1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant.
3. When the insect or bird lands on the plant, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. The insect or bird travels to another plant of the same species.
5. When the insect or bird lands on the new plant, the pollen is transferred to the new plant.
6. If the plant is outdoors, there is a higher chance of more flowers being pollinated as there are more opportunities for insects or birds to visit and transfer pollen between plants.
