1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
7. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to resemble a frog
8. If fewer eggs hatch, there will be fewer tadpoles
9. With fewer tadpoles, there will be fewer frogs
10. The survival rate of the remaining tadpoles may increase due to less competition for resources
11. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "complete"
