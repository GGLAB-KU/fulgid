1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. If number of tadpoles born is less than expected, adjust for lower number of frogs that will be formed
5. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
6. Tadpole grows larger over time
7. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
8. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to resemble a frog
9. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "formed"
10. If number of frogs formed is less than expected, adjust for potential impact on ecosystem and food chain.
