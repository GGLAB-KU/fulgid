1. Initialize egg variable as "unhatched"
2. Wait for egg to hatch
3. If egg hatches, set tadpole variable as "born"
4. Tadpole swims with siblings and avoids predators
5. Tadpole grows larger over time
6. If less tadpoles grow larger, it may result in fewer frogs being formed
7. When tadpole reaches a certain size, it loses its tail
8. Tadpole develops limbs and begins to move on land
9. When tadpole has fully developed into a frog, set frog variable as "formed"
10. If fewer tadpoles develop into frogs, it may affect the overall population of frogs in the ecosystem.
