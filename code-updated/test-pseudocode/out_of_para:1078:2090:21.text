I'm sorry, but the proposed pseudocode is not related to the given statement. The given statement talks about the effect of fewer plates smashing together on DNA replication, which is not related to the steps involved in DNA replication. 

However, I can provide a pseudocode representation of the given statement:

1. If fewer plates smash together:
   a. The replication process may slow down
   b. The accuracy of DNA replication may decrease
   c. The chances of errors in DNA replication may increase
2. This may lead to mutations in the DNA sequence, which can have various effects on the organism.
