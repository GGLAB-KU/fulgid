1. Set fish as eggs
2. Randomly determine the percentage of eggs that will hatch
3. Hatch the determined percentage of eggs
4. Emergence of larvae
5. Maturation and growth of larvae
6. Development of adolescent fish (or fry)
7. Growth of adolescent fish
8. Check for sub-stages based on species or type
9. Maturation of fish into adult
10. Determine the percentage of adult fish that can lay eggs
11. Calculate the number of eggs laid by the adult fish
12. Repeat the process from step 2 for the newly laid eggs. 

Note: If less eggs hatch, it will result in fewer fish becoming adults, which will ultimately affect the population of the species.
