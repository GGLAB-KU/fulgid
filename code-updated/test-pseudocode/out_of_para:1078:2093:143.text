1. Initiate DNA replication with proteins
2. Break hydrogen bonds holding DNA strand together
3. For each side of the strand:
   a. Read the strand with a polymerase
   b. Add complimentary nucleotides
   c. Match all bases
   d. Check for any interference from the presence of frogs
   e. If interference is detected, pause replication until the environment is suitable for proper replication
   f. If no interference is detected, continue replication
   g. Form new DNA strand
4. Seal new pieces into two new strands with DNA ligase.
