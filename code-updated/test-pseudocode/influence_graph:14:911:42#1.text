1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, rivers, swamps, and plants
2. Convert water from initial source into water vapor
3. Form water vapor into droplets in clouds
4. Determine if droplets will become rain or snow
5. If less water droplets form in clouds, increase the likelihood of snow formation
6. If snow, allow droplets to accumulate and eventually melt into water
7. If rain, allow droplets to fall to the ground
8. Some water will seep into the ground
9. Some water will flow down streams into rivers and oceans.
