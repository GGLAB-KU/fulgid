1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant.
3. When the insect or bird lands on the plant, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. The insect or bird travels to another plant of the same species.
5. When the insect or bird lands on the new plant, the pollen is transferred to the new plant.
6. If more magma cools, it may create new habitats for the flowering plants, which could increase the number of plants available for pollination.
7. Alternatively, if the cooling magma causes changes in the environment that are unfavorable for the flowering plants, it could decrease the number of plants available for pollination.
