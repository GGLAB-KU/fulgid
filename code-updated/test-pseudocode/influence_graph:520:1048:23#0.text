1. FemaleFish lays Eggs
2. If Eggs are not eaten by Predator, then Eggs hatch into Larvae
3. Larvae eat and grow
4. Larvae form into JuvenileFish
5. JuvenileFish grow into AdultFish
6. AdultFish mate
7. FemaleFish lays Eggs
8. If Eggs are eaten by Predator, then fewer Larvae will hatch
9. As a result, fewer JuvenileFish will form
10. This will lead to a decrease in the number of AdultFish
11. The decrease in AdultFish will affect the mating process and result in fewer Eggs being laid by the FemaleFish.
