9. If more magma cools, monitor the nutrient levels in the soil and adjust as necessary to ensure the pumpkins have enough nutrients to grow larger
10. If more magma cools, monitor the amount of sunlight the pumpkins are receiving and adjust as necessary to ensure they are getting enough light to grow larger
