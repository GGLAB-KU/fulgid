1. Define a flowering plant with stamen and pistils.
2. Wait for an insect or bird to land on the plant.
3. When the insect or bird lands on the plant, some of the pollen sticks to it.
4. The insect or bird travels to another plant of the same species.
5. When the insect or bird lands on the new plant, the pollen is transferred to the new plant.
6. If humans make an effort to protect green spaces, there may be fewer insects or birds visiting the plants for pollination.
7. This could result in less pollen being transferred between plants and potentially lead to a decrease in the number of flowers being pollinated.
