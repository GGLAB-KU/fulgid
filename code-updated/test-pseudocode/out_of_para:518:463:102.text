1. Less water droplets in clouds become rain or snow
2. Decreased precipitation leads to less water in rivers and lakes
3. Reduced water levels in rivers and lakes may lead to decreased fish populations
4. If fish populations decrease, it may affect the food chain and ecosystem
5. The impact on fish populations may depend on the specific species and their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
