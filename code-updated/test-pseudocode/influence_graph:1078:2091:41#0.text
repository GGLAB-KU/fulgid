1. Check for increased body activity
2. If increased body activity is detected, proceed to step 3, else proceed to step 4
3. Adjust replication process to account for increased activity, such as increasing the number of polymerases or slowing down the replication rate
4. Break hydrogen bonds holding DNA strand together
5. Read each side of the strand with a polymerase
6. Add complimentary nucleotides to each side
7. Match all bases on each side
8. Form new DNA strand
9. Seal new pieces into two new strands with DNA ligase.
