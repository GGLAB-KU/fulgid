1. Input: Liquid
2. Heat Liquid from external source
3. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
4. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
5. Increase in temperature of Liquid
6. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
7. If temperature has reached boiling point, change state of Liquid to Gas
8. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
9. Check if all Liquid has turned to Gas
10. If all Liquid has not turned to Gas, continue heating
11. If more water vapors are rising, increase the rate of evaporation
12. Output: No Liquid left behind
