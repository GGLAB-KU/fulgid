1. Initialize tadpole
2. While tadpole has no hind legs:
   a. Feed tadpole
   b. Monitor growth
   c. If hind legs appear, go to step 3
3. While tadpole has a tail:
   a. Feed tadpole
   b. Monitor growth
   c. If tail is lost, go to step 4
4. Initialize frog
5. While frog is alive:
   a. Feed frog
   b. Monitor health
   c. If frog mates with another frog, go to step 6
   d. If frog is injured by global warming, go to step 7
6. Initialize tadpole
7. If there are fewer frogs due to global warming:
   a. Increase efforts to protect and conserve frog populations
   b. Monitor tadpole growth and survival closely
   c. Implement measures to mitigate the effects of global warming on frog populations
8. Go to step 2.
