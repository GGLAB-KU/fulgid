1. Input: Rocks
2. Process:
   a. Check if rocks are present in the area
   b. If rocks are present, continue with the following steps:
      i. Rocks melt into magma
      ii. Magma cools in the crust
      iii. Magma rises to the surface and becomes lava
      iv. Lava cools
      v. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock
   c. If rocks are not present, skip the melting process and continue with the following steps:
      i. Magma is pushed out of the chambers onto the surface
      ii. Lava cools
      iii. Cooled lava becomes igneous rock
3. Output: Igneous rock
