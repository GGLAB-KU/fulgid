1. FOR each female frog
2.     FOR each mating season
3.         LAY thousands of eggs
4.         CREATE egg clusters that FLOAT in water
5.         IF there are no tadpoles with gills that HATCH from the eggs
6.             DECREASE the number of potential frogs
7.         ELSE
8.             ALLOW tadpoles to SWIM in water until they grow legs
9.             ABSORB their tails
10.            TRANSFORM the tadpole into a froglet
11.            WAIT for the froglet to develop into a FROG
12.        END IF
13.    END FOR
14. END FOR

Note: In this updated pseudocode, if there are no tadpoles that hatch from the eggs, the number of potential frogs will be decreased.
