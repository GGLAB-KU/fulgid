1. Deliver oxygen through blood
2. Break down proteins and acids in liver
3. If liver breaks down more acids:
   a. Increase the amount of waste released in the form of urea
4. Transport urea and carbon dioxide to kidneys through blood
5. Strain urea and salts from blood in kidneys
6. Transport carbon dioxide byproduct back to lungs through blood
7. Exhale carbon dioxide from lungs.
