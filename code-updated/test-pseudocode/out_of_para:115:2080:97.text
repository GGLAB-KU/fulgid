1. Set up tectonic plates
2. Move plates towards each other
3. Check for collision
4. If collision occurs, crumple edges of plates
5. Form ridges from crumpled edges
6. Check for magma presence
7. If magma present, force it to the surface
8. Form volcano from magma
9. Check for changes in Earth's rotation
10. If changes occur, assess impact on tectonic plate movement
11. Adjust plate movement accordingly
12. Monitor for any resulting changes in crust elevation above ground level.
