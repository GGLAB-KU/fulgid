1. Set water in a container
2. Expose container to heat energy (e.g. sunlight)
3. Check water temperature
4. If water temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating
5. If water temperature is between 32 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit, proceed to step 6
6. Heat breaks down water molecules
7. Water molecules escape from the water
8. Water becomes vapor
9. Vapor evaporates into the atmosphere
10. If the atmosphere temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the vapor will freeze and form ice
11. If there are snow days, the ice will accumulate and increase in size.
