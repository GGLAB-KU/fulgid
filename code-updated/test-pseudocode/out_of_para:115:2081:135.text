1. Set up a loop for tectonic plate movement
2. If two plates collide, continue to the next step
3. The edges of the plates crumple up, forming ridges
4. If the ridges are high enough, they become mountain ranges
5. If magma is forced to the surface, continue to the next step
6. If the soil is more fertile, the magma may have more nutrients to feed on, potentially increasing the likelihood of a volcano forming
7. Magma forms a volcano
8. End loop.
