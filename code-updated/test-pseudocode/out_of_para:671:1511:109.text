1. Input: Liquid
2. Heat Liquid from external source
3. Increase energy of molecules in Liquid
4. Molecules in Liquid start to move faster
5. Increase in temperature of Liquid
6. Check if surface of Liquid is stable
7. If surface is stable, continue heating Liquid
8. If surface is not stable, reduce heat input
9. Check if temperature of Liquid has reached boiling point
10. If temperature has reached boiling point, change Liquid to gas state
11. Gas molecules float out into atmosphere
12. Check if all Liquid has turned to gas
13. If all Liquid has turned to gas, evaporation is complete
14. Output: No Liquid left behind
