1. Begin DNA replication process
2. Check if the helix is intact and able to split properly
3. If the helix is not intact, abort the replication process
4. If the helix is intact, break up the helix using chemicals
5. Split the helix into two strands
6. Use each strand as the basis for a new DNA strand
7. Form the new DNA strands by pairing complementary nucleotides
8. Complete the replication process
9. End the procedure.
