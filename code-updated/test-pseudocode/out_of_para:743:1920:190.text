1. Bee lands on flower
2. Bee's feet slip into grooves holding pollen sacs
3. Bee flies off, carrying pollen sac
4. Bee lands on another plant
5. Pollen sac falls off and pollinates plant
6. If more tadpoles grow larger:
   7. There may be more frogs to eat bees, reducing the number of bees available for pollination
   8. However, larger tadpoles may also mean more nutrients in the ecosystem, leading to healthier plants and more flowers being produced
   9. Overall, the effect on pollination may depend on the balance between these factors.
