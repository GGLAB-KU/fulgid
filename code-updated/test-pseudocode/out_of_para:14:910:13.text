I'm sorry, but the updated statement "suppose less fish eat frogs happens, how will it affect more rain will fall" does not seem to be directly related to the original procedure of the water cycle. Could you please provide more context or information so that I can better understand the problem and provide an appropriate pseudocode representation?
