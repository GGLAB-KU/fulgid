1. Set variable "eggs_laid" to number of eggs laid
2. Set variable "bees" to number of bees produced from eggs
3. For each bee:
   a. Bee lands on flower
   b. Little hairs on bee's legs attach to pollen sacs from stamens of flower
   c. Bee flies away with pollen
   d. Bee lands on new flower
   e. Pollen sacs are rubbed off onto stigma of new flower
4. If "eggs_laid" increases:
   a. Update variable "bees" to reflect new number of bees produced
   b. Repeat steps 3a-e for each additional bee produced.
