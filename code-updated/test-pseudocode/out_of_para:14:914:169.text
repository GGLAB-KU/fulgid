1. Set initial water source as oceans, lakes, rivers, swamps, and plants
2. While the replication process runs smoothly:
   a. Convert water from initial source into water vapor
   b. Form water vapor into droplets in clouds
   c. Determine if droplets will become rain or snow
   d. If rain, allow droplets to fall to the ground
   e. If snow, allow droplets to accumulate and eventually melt into water
   f. Some water will seep into the ground
   g. Some water will flow down streams into rivers and oceans
3. If water stops getting evaporated:
   a. The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will decrease
   b. The formation of clouds will decrease
   c. The amount of rain and snow will decrease
   d. The amount of water that seeps into the ground and flows down streams will decrease
   e. The water cycle will be disrupted and could lead to droughts and other environmental impacts.
