1. Set fish as eggs
2. Hatch eggs
3. Emergence of larvae
4. Maturation and growth of larvae
5. Development of adolescent fish (or fry)
6. Growth of adolescent fish
7. Check for sub-stages based on species or type
8. Maturation of fish into adult
9. Adult fish can lay more eggs
10. If more conservation efforts are achieved:
    a. Increase survival rate of eggs and larvae
    b. Increase availability of food for larvae and adolescent fish
    c. Reduce pollution and habitat destruction
    d. Increase protection from predators
    e. Result in more larvae successfully maturing into fish.
