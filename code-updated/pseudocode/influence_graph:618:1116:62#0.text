1. Input air into lungs
2. Lungs extract less oxygen from air
3. Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to bloodstream
4. Hemoglobin in red blood cells binds to less oxygen
5. More red blood cells are produced to compensate for the lower oxygen levels
6. Red blood cells transport oxygen throughout the body
7. Oxygen diffuses from capillaries into cells.
