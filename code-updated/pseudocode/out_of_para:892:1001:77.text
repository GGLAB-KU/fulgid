1. Set temperature of water in clouds to very cold
2. If temperature is below freezing point, continue to step 3. Otherwise, repeat step 1.
3. Form ice crystals from the cold water
4. If there are less water droplets in the surrounding area, continue to step 6. Otherwise, continue to step 5.
5. Absorb surrounding water droplets to grow the ice crystals into snowflakes
6. If there are less snowflakes formed, the amount of snow will be reduced. The snowflakes fall to the ground.
