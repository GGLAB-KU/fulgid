1. Take in carbon dioxide through stomata in leaves
2. Absorb water through roots
3. Check if chloroplast cells are present in leaves
4. If chloroplast cells are present, absorb energy from sunlight using chlorophyll
5. If less light is available, reduce the amount of energy absorbed
6. Split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using absorbed energy
7. Release oxygen into the atmosphere
8. Combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to create glucose
9. If less energy is absorbed, less glucose will be produced
10. Use glucose as food for the plant.
