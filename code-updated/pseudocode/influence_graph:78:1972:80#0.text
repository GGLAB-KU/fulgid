1. Begin erosion process of rocks by wind and water.
2. Pick up sediment that came off the rocks.
3. If less sediment is picked up by wind and water, go to step 6.
4. Carry sediment to an area using wind, water, air, or ice.
5. Deposit sediment on the same spot multiple times.
6. Allow sediment to pile on top of other sediment for a long time.
7. Compress sediment near the bottom with the weight of newer sediment.
8. Push sediment together with heavy weight to form sedimentary rock.
9. If less sediment is picked up by wind and water, the amount of sedimentary rock formed will be reduced.
