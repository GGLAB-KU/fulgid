1. Create a photovoltaic cell with two layers of semiconductor material.
2. Dope the top layer with impurities to allow for a negative charge.
3. Dope the bottom layer to allow for a positive charge.
4. Create an electric field between the two layers to allow for the flow of electrons from negative to positive.
5. Allow sunlight to enter the cell.
6. If less sunlight is available, the amount of energy produced will decrease.
7. If more sunlight is available, the amount of energy produced will increase.
8. Add an external circuit to allow for the exchange of electrons to continue.
9. Provide the cell's owner with a flow of electricity.
