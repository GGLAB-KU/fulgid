1. Input: Carbon dioxide
2. Input: Water
3. Light reaction to produce ATP
4. If less sugar is created using carbon dioxide and energy from ATP:
   a. Decrease the amount of sugar produced
   b. Decrease the amount of oxygen produced
5. Else:
   a. ATP + Carbon dioxide = Sugar
   b. Output: Oxygen
6. Output: Water vapor or reuse water. 

Note: The exact amount of decrease in sugar and oxygen production will depend on the extent to which less sugar is created.
