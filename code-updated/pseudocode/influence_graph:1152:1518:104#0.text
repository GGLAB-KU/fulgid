1. Check if the atom has too few or too many neutrons.
2. If the atom is less stable, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, end the procedure.
3. Determine the type of decay: alpha or beta.
4. If alpha decay, release two protons and two neutrons from the atom.
5. If beta decay, change a neutron into a proton and an electron.
6. Join the proton with the nucleus of the atom.
7. Release the electron.
8. Check if the atom is still less stable.
9. If the atom is still less stable, repeat steps 3-7 until the atom becomes stable.
10. End the procedure.
