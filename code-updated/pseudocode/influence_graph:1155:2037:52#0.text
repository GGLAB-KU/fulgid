1. Accumulate dead organic material on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps.
2. Mix the organic material with mud and sand.
3. Pile more sediment on top of the organic layer.
4. Apply heat and pressure to transform the organic layer into kerogen.
5. Leave the kerogen alone to allow the molecules to crack.
6. Break up the kerogen molecules into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
7. If more sediment forms, it will increase the pressure on the kerogen, which may cause it to break down further into lighter molecules, resulting in less oil and more natural gas.
