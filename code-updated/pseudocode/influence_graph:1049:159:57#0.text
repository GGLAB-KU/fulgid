1. Input: Water and iron object
2. Check if the iron object is rained on
3. If the iron object is rained on, the iron will dissolve slower
4. Combine water and iron object
5. Check for presence of carbon dioxide in the air
6. If carbon dioxide is present, combine with water to form carbonic acid
7. As carbonic acid is formed, iron object starts to dissolve slower due to rain
8. Break down some water into hydrogen and oxygen
9. Free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together
10. Form iron oxide, which is rust
11. Output: Rusty iron object with slower dissolution due to rain.
