1. Choose a high spot, often in a tree
2. Collect bits of sticks and grass
3. Place the sticks and grasses between support branches
4. Add leaves, mud, and spider webs to the sticks
5. Use the mud, leaves, and webs to glue the sticks together
6. Ensure the nest is solid enough to support the eggs
7. If there is more ecological damage from humans, the availability of sticks, grasses, and support branches may decrease, resulting in smaller or less sturdy nests.
