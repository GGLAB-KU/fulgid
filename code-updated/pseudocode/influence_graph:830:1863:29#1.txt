1. Define the flu virus and its receptors on the surface of the virus particle.
2. Identify a target cell for the virus to infect.
3. Check if the immune system is weakened due to poor nutrition.
4. If the immune system is weakened, the virus may be able to infect more cells.
5. Lock onto the target cell using the chemical receptors on the surface of the virus particle.
6. Dock onto the cell surface and enter the cell.
7. Take over the cell and use it like a factory to produce thousands or millions of copies of new viruses.
8. Release the copies from the cell and infect other cells to make more viruses.
9. If the immune system is weakened, the virus may be able to infect more cells and produce more copies of the virus.
10. Escape from the body and infect a new victim.
