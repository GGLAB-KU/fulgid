1. If the Earth gets hotter:
   a. Increase in temperature may cause rocks to expand and contract
   b. Increase in temperature may cause more frequent and intense weather events, such as heavy rain and wind
2. More frequent and intense weather events can lead to faster erosion of rocks
3. Increased expansion and contraction of rocks due to temperature changes can cause cracks to form and deepen, leading to faster erosion
4. Overall, hotter temperatures may lead to more and faster erosion of rocks.
