1. Set temperature of water in clouds to very cold
2. If temperature is below freezing point, continue to step 3. Otherwise, repeat step 1.
3. If water is scarce, continue to step 6. Otherwise, continue to step 4.
4. Form ice crystals from the cold water
5. While there are water droplets in the surrounding area, continue to step 6. Otherwise, continue to step 7.
