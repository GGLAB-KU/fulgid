1. Input chemicals that cause acid rain
2. Input level of conservation
3. If level of conservation is less than optimal, then increase the likelihood of more acid rain occurring
4. Chemicals reach atmosphere
5. Chemicals fall onto ground as acid rain
6. Acid rain scours rocks
7. Vegetation is destroyed by acid rain
8. Lack of vegetation alters surrounding environment.
