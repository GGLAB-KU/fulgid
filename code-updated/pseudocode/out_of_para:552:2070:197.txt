I'm sorry, but I cannot update the proposed pseudocode based on the given statement as it is not related to the original procedure described. The original procedure is about the digestive system and the pancreas releasing hormones to regulate blood sugar levels. The statement about being allergic to some forms of contraception and its effect on the pancreas working softer is not related to the original procedure. If you have any other questions or concerns, please let me know.
