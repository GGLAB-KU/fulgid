1. Initialize variables for crack development, pressure, rock hardness, seismic wave generation, and earthquake frequency.
2. While cracks are developing:
   a. Check for cracks deep beneath the surface.
   b. If cracks are present, increase their length and size.
   c. Apply pressure to rocks on both sides of the cracks.
   d. Check for rock hardness and adjust pressure accordingly.
   e. Continue to develop cracks and apply pressure.
3. When rocks begin to crumble:
   a. Release a lot of energy.
   b. Generate seismic waves.
   c. If earthquake frequency is low, store the energy for a longer period of time.
   d. If earthquake frequency is high, release the energy immediately.
   e. The stored energy can lead to more/stronger earthquakes when released.
4. Adjust earthquake frequency based on the number of earthquakes that occur.
   a. If fewer earthquakes occur, increase the likelihood of more/stronger earthquakes.
   b. If more earthquakes occur, decrease the likelihood of more/stronger earthquakes.
