1. if tsunami occurs:
2.     while waves hit the coast:
3.         energy from waves pushes water and sediment
4.         more sediment is eroded from the land due to the force of the waves
5.         water washes sediment back
6.     end while
7. else:

9.         energy from waves pushes water and sediment
10.        sediment helps erode land like sandpaper
11.        water washes sediment back
