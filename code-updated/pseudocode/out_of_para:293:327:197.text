1. Obtain glucose and oxygen
2. Combine glucose and oxygen to create carbon dioxide
3. Release energy
4. Check if there is enough oxygen to repeat the process
5. If there is not enough oxygen, obtain more oxygen from the air
6. Check if there are enough minerals in the water to support oxygen transport in the body
7. If there are not enough minerals, less oxygen will reach the body
8. Repeat the process from step 2.
