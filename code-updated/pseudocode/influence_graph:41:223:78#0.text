1. Initialize variables for crack development, pressure, rock hardness, and seismic wave generation.
2. Set a threshold for the number of earthquakes that can occur.
3. While the number of earthquakes is below the threshold:
   a. Determine the size and length of the cracks.
   b. Calculate the pressure exerted by the earth on both sides of the cracks.
   c. Determine the hardness of the rocks on both sides of the cracks.
   d. Apply pressure to the rocks, causing them to press against each other.
   e. Monitor the development of the cracks and the movement of the earth.
   f. If the pressure and movement cause rocks to crumble, release a lot of energy.
   g. Generate seismic waves from the energy released.
   h. Increase the strength of the seismic waves if there have been fewer earthquakes than expected.
4. End the procedure when the number of earthquakes has reached the threshold or when a very strong earthquake occurs.
