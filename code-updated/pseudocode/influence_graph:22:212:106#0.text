1. Create a large rocky area with higher elevation than surrounding areas.
2. Allow precipitation to fall onto the rocky area.
3. Collect the water from precipitation and allow it to form a stream.
4. Direct the stream towards lower elevation.
5. Allow the stream to continue flowing and growing in size until it becomes a river.
6. Ensure that the river continues to flow along the same path for a long time.
7. Allow the river to erode the rocky area that it touches.
8. If a smaller river erodes the rock, it will result in less or smaller valleys being formed.
