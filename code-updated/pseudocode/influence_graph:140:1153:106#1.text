1. Person inhales clear air
2. Oxygen travels through bronchial tubes to lungs
3. Oxygen is absorbed into bloodstream
4. Bloodstream circulates oxygen throughout body
5. Cells in body exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide
6. Carbon dioxide is carried by bloodstream back to lungs
7. Lungs exhale carbon dioxide through nose and mouth
8. If there is a smaller amount of oxygen in the clear air, less oxygen will be absorbed into the bloodstream
9. This may result in decreased oxygen delivery to the body's cells.
