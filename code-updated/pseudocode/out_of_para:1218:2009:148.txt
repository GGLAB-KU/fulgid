1. Initialize a network of trees.
2. Allow the trees to grow and form a forest ecosystem.
3. As trees die off, leave the dead material on the forest floor.
4. The dead material provides nutrients for new trees to grow.
5. The new trees provide shelter for organisms to thrive.
6. If acid rain occurs, adjust the growth rate of the trees accordingly.
7. If acid rain is severe, reduce the growth rate of the trees or prevent new trees from growing.
8. If acid rain persists, the forest ecosystem may be damaged and unable to support new growth.
9. Repeat steps 3-8 to continue the cycle of growth and decay.
10. The ecosystem known as a forest is made, but may be affected by acid rain.
