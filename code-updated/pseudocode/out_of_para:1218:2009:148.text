1. Initialize a network of trees.
2. Allow the trees to grow and form a forest ecosystem.
3. As trees die off, leave the dead material on the forest floor.
4. The dead material provides nutrients for new trees to grow.
5. If acid rain occurs, monitor the pH levels of the soil and water.
6. If the pH levels become too acidic, it may affect the growth of trees and other organisms in the forest ecosystem.
7. If the forest ecosystem is negatively impacted by acid rain, it may result in less forest formation.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 to continue monitoring the forest ecosystem and its response to acid rain.
