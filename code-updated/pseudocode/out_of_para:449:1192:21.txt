1. Set rock as magma from sas volcano
2. While rock is hot, cool it down
3. Crystals form within the rock
4. Set the rock as igneous
5. If the igneous rock is exposed to weathering and erosion, it breaks down into sediment
6. If the sediment becomes a smaller rock, set it as a new type of sedimentary rock
7. Set the new sedimentary rock as the rock
8. If the rock is subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity, it becomes metamorphic rock
9. Set the metamorphic rock as the new rock
10. If the metamorphic rock is exposed to high temperatures, it melts and becomes magma again
11. Repeat from step 1.

If the sediment becomes a smaller rock, it may affect the formation of more igneous rock by reducing the amount of sediment available for the process. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the amount of igneous rock formed over time.
