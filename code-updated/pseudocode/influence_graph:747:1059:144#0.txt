1. Input: Surface water
2. Seep water below soil
3. Water comes into contact with rock
4. If rock is porous, continue to step 5. If rock is impermeable, end procedure.
5. Rock is eroded by water over time
6. Space in rock becomes larger
7. If space is large enough to enter, continue to step 8. If space is not large enough, continue to step 5.
8. Space becomes a cave
9. If space rock is bigger, continue to step 10. If space rock is not bigger, continue to step 11.
10. Water continues to erode the rock, making the space larger and forming a bigger cave. Continue to step 7.
11. Water rushes through cave
12. If water continues to flow, continue to step 13. If water stops flowing, end procedure.
13. Cave becomes a cavern. 
14. End procedure.
