1. Set up two pots, one slightly smaller than the other.
2. Fill the smaller pot with water.
3. Place the larger pot upside down over the smaller pot, making sure it covers it completely.
4. Heat the water in the smaller pot until it starts to evaporate.
5. Lower the heat slightly to increase the rate of evaporation.
6. The water vapor will collect on the lid of the larger pot.
7. The water droplets will eventually drip down into the larger pot as fresh water.
8. The salt will be left behind in the smaller pot.
