1. Initialize a network of trees.
2. Allow the trees to grow and form a forest ecosystem.
3. If a shadow is created, determine the source and duration of the shadow.
4. If the shadow is caused by a natural occurrence (e.g. cloud cover), continue with the growth and decay cycle as normal.
5. If the shadow is caused by a man-made structure (e.g. building), monitor the impact on the forest and adjust management practices as necessary.
6. As trees die off, leave the dead material on the forest floor.
7. The dead material provides nutrients for new trees to grow.
8. The new trees provide shelter for organisms to thrive.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 to continue the cycle of growth and decay.
10. If the forest is infected with dead trees, implement measures to prevent the spread of disease and promote the growth of healthy trees.
11. The ecosystem known as a forest is made.
