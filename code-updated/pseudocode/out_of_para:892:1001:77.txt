1. Set temperature of water in clouds to very cold
2. If temperature is below freezing point, continue to step 3. Otherwise, repeat step 1.
3. Form ice crystals from the cold water
4. While there are water droplets in the surrounding area and there is enough water to freeze, continue to step 5. Otherwise, continue to step 6.
5. Absorb surrounding water droplets to grow the ice crystals into snowflakes
6. If there is not enough water to freeze, less snow will form. Snowflakes fall to the ground.
