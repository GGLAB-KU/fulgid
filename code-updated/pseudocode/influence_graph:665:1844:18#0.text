1. Set a pot of water on the stove.
2. Add salt to the water.
3. Turn on the stove and heat the water until it boils.
4. Place a collection container above the pot to collect the water vapor.
5. Allow the water vapor to cool down.
6. The water vapor will condense into liquid water in the collection container.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 if necessary to collect more water.
8. The salt will remain in the original pot of water and can be discarded.
9. If a greater amount of water is boiled, more water vapor will be produced, which can result in more salt being removed from the water.
