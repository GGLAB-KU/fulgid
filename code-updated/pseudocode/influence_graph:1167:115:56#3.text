1. Set the mass of the Sun.
2. Calculate the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on its mass.
3. Determine the pressure on the Sun due to the gravitational force.
4. Check if the pressure is sufficient for nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms.
5. If yes, initiate nuclear fusion reactions.
6. Calculate the energy released from the reactions.
7. Emit different kinds of light corresponding to the energy released.
8. Calculate the amount of light that will travel towards the Earth.
9. Check if the mass of the Sun has decreased.
10. If yes, recalculate the gravitational force and pressure on the Sun.
11. Determine if the pressure is still sufficient for nuclear fusion.
12. If not, stop the nuclear fusion reactions.
13. Calculate the new amount of light that will travel towards the Earth.
14. Emit the updated amount of light towards the Earth.
