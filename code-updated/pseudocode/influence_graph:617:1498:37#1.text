1. Take a deep breath inward
2. Transport more air to the lungs
3. Air reaches the alveoli
4. Air passes into the blood within small capillaries in the alveoli
5. Gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood
6. Red blood cells pick up the dissolved oxygen
7. Red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme
8. Circulate red blood cells throughout the body and reach the various tissues
9. Within small capillaries, heme releases the oxygen
10. More oxygen is released by the blood due to the increased amount of oxygen inhaled with the deep breath.
