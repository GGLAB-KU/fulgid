2.     energy from waves pushes water and sediment
3.     sediment helps erode land like sandpaper
4.     if icebergs form and lower water levels:
5.         waves may have less energy to erode land
6.         sediment may not be pushed as far inland
7.     else:
8.         water washes sediment back
