1. Set variable "egg" to true
2. If "egg" is true, set variable "larva" to true and "egg" to false
3. While "larva" is true, set variable "molting" to true and "larva" to false
4. If "molting" is true, repeat step 3 until "molting" is false
5. Set variable "pupa" to true and "molting" to false
6. If "pupa" is true, set variable "metamorphosis" to true and "pupa" to false
7. While "metamorphosis" is true, set variable "changing" to true and "metamorphosis" to false
8. If "changing" is true, repeat step 7 until "changing" is false
9. Set variable "butterfly" to true and "changing" to false
10. If "butterfly" is true, set variable "emerged" to true and "butterfly" to false
11. If "emerged" is true, set variable "flying" to true and "emerged" to false
12. If "flying" is true, the procedure is complete.

Note: If less larvae are formed, it will result in fewer pupae and ultimately fewer butterflies. This is because the number of butterflies is directly proportional to the number of larvae that undergo metamorphosis. Therefore, if there are fewer larvae, there will be fewer butterflies.
